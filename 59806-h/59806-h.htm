<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>I</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>An immense gallery, five hundred feet long, occupied
the upper floor of the main factory-building.
Looking down the gallery, a perspective of iron
girders spanned the roof, gaunt skeletons of architecture,
uncompromising, inexorably utilitarian, inflexible,
remorseless. A drone of machinery filled
the air, neither very loud nor very near at hand, but
softly and unremittingly continuous; the drone of
clanking, of loosely-running wheels and leather
belts, muffled by the intervening floor into a not
unpleasant murmur. Outside the windows three
chimneys reared their heads side by side, emitting
three parallel streams of smoke, gigantic black
plumes that floated horizontally away over the
flooded country, and that at night were flecked with
red sparks as they flowed out from the red glare
at their base.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>All these things, the chimneys and the girders,
were crushingly larger than the men who laboured
amongst them. The men seemed of pigmy size as
they pushed their hand-trucks along the floor of the
big gallery. They pushed them down the narrow
passage-ways left between the vats. The gallery
was full of vats, set in pairs down the whole length
of the building; square vats twenty feet each way,
as large and as deep as an ordinary room. Some
of the vats were empty, temporarily not in use;
some were only half full; but in most the hot, liquid
soap boiled and bubbled right up to the rim.</p>

<p class='c008'>The smell which filled the gallery was the smell
of the soap, pungent and acrid on the surface, but
fat and nauseating underneath, rasping the throat
of the chance visitor before it penetrated deeper
with its hot, furry smell that tickled and disgusted
the sensitiveness at the back of his nose. The
chance visitor rarely lingered long in the gallery.
He would stand for a few moments watching the
men that came and went in their splashed overalls,
indifferent to his presence; then he would turn to go
carefully down the steep iron stair into the pleasanter
rooms where white powder was heaped on the
floor in miniature mountains, and where lines of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>girls seated on high stools were occupied in tying
ribbons with the twist of dexterity round the necks
of scent bottles, and the room was filled with scent
like a garden of orange-trees in blossom.</p>

<p class='c008'>Up in the gallery, the soap in the vats moved
uneasily with the motion of an evil quicksand. The
soap was yellow, and its consistency one of slimy
liquidity. If the vat were not sufficiently full, the
quantity increased mysteriously from below, the
level rising thanks to the unseen source of supply.
It was not hard to believe that the recesses of the
vat were inhabited by some foul and secret monster
whose jaws emitted the viscid, yellow stream
to conceal his abode. The soap moved restlessly,
boiling and bursting into little craters, which subsided,
leaving wrinkles and circles on the surface.
Quiet for a moment, it heaved in another place;
heaved slowly and deliberately, but did not break;
heaved again; broke with a spout of steam and a
sluggish splash as the walls of the crater fell in.
It was never altogether still. It seemed alive, because
it swelled and breathed and vomited, or at least
it seemed as though some live creature dwelt within,
occasioning by its movements the disturbances and
eruptions of the slime.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>In other vats a wrinkled brown skin had formed
over the cooling soap, a skin puckered and broken
up into valleys and chasms, plains and ridges, so
that of all things it most resembled the physical
map of a country. The parallel was exact as to
colour, even to the greenish stretches at the bottom
of the valleys. Mountain ridges three inches high,
chasms three inches deep, plateaux six inches across,
the landscape of some dead but perpetually changing
world. For here the slime moved also, but with a
difference; it did not seethe, it did not erupt; it
rather subsided; was a dead, rather than a living
thing. The monster that dwelt in those depths had
died, and lay at the bottom, a heap of corruption
the imagination would not willingly picture.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other vats were empty, and if the hot boiling
soap resembled a shifting quicksand, and the cooling
soap the desolation of a dead world, the empty vats
resembled the sea-bottom. The others, with their
hint of greed and evil, might be more terrifying;
these empty vats were infinitely more fantastic.
Their sides were caked with the dry soap, brown-yellow,
and their depths were surprisingly revealed;
ending in a blunt point, like the point of a cone;
they were sunk lower than the floor of the gallery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>into an unlighted chamber of corresponding size
below. In these empty vats, various portions of apparatus
were brought to light: immense chains,
caked and corroded, hung like ship’s cables and were
lost in the deposit at the bottom; vast strainers swung
against the sides; ropes, stiffened hard as wood,
spanned diagonally from side to side; and, emerging
from the tapering depths, stumps of wreckage
stood up, transformed from their original shape to
stalagmites of dry frangible matter, that would
chip away, crisp and powdery, betraying the nature
of their kernel,—was it a shovel? was it an anchor?
was it the decaying bones of the ancient monster?—and
the low parapets of the vats were coated with the
same brittle dryness that yellowed the walls of those
grotesque and extraordinary pits.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>The workers were subordinate to the factory; it
was a giant, a monster, that they served. At night
the red glow from the chimneys,—the glow from
the fires that must never flag or die,—accentuated
the disregard of man’s convenience. To keep alive
that red breath of activity, men must forego their
privilege of sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tragedy in the household of the Denes was
not allowed to interrupt the general work of the
factory, but the overseer, Mr. Calthorpe, offered
Silas Dene a week, and Gregory Dene a day,—the
day of the funeral,—as a concession to their mourning.
He thought the offer sufficiently generous.</p>

<p class='c008'>The brothers Dene, however, refused it.</p>

<p class='c008'>They lived in a double-cottage; Gregory with his
wife in one half; Silas and his wife, before her
sudden death, in the other. Although situated in
the village street, it was a lonely cottage, for “the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>black Denes” did not encourage neighbourly communion,
nor did the neighbours trouble them with
unwelcome advances. This was not surprising, for
they were indeed a sinister race to whom affliction
seemed naturally drawn. Nature cursed them from
the hour of their birth with physical deficiencies and
spiritual savagery; whether or no, as some said,
the latter was only to be expected as the outcome
of the former, the name of Dene remained the intimidation
of the village.</p>

<p class='c008'>Others again said that Nature was not so much
to be held responsible as the Denes’ father, whom
everybody had known as a rake, and who never
ought to have married, much less begotten children.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of the two brothers, Gregory had been deaf and
dumb from birth, and Silas blind. Their physique,
however, was full of splendour, and they were accounted
two of the most valuable workers in the
factory,—magnificent men, tall, muscular, and dark.</p>

<p class='c008'>Calthorpe came to their cottage directly he was
told of the accident. It was then evening, and the
accident had occurred in the earlier part of the
afternoon. Calthorpe knew no details beyond the
bare fact that Silas Dene’s wife had been discovered,
a mass of almost unidentifiable disfigurement, lying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>across the railway line after the passage of the little
local train. He had been told this much by the men
who had come running with the news to his office;
they had come breathless, shocked, mystified; he
had understood at once that they were mystified;
they had made no comment, but Calthorpe had been
quick to catch the hint of mystery; any concern of
the Denes was always luscious with mystery.</p>

<p class='c008'>He found Silas, the blind man, sitting in his
kitchen, chewing an unlighted pipe. He appeared
to be strangely indifferent. A little man named
Hambley, Silas Dene’s only crony, sat in a dark
corner, not speaking, but observing everything with
bright furtive eyes, like the eyes of a weasel. He
hugged himself in his corner; a sallow faced little
man, with a red tip to his thin nose. Gregory Dene
was in the kitchen too, and Gregory’s wife, with
frightened eyes, was laying the table for supper;
she moved quickly, placing cups and plates, and
casting rapid glances at the two men.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m terribly distressed, Silas,” Calthorpe began.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What, you too, Mr. Calthorpe, come to condole?”
cried the blind man, laughing loudly. “Well,
it takes an accident to make me popular, it seems;
I haven’t had so many callers in the last four years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>as in the last four hours. Sit down, Mr. Calthorpe;
I ask ’em all to sit down. Nan, give a chair.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Calthorpe sat down uneasily, beneath the silent
scrutiny of Gregory and the quick glances of
Gregory’s wife. The burning and sightless eyes of
Silas were also bent upon him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have only just heard the news,” he began again,
“or I would have come sooner....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right. The neighbours ran to help,
and to nose out what they could; the parson came
too, he’s upstairs now. All very helpful,” said Silas,
with another burst of laughter. “Gregory, my
brother, too, though he isn’t much company, but
we understand one another. Don’t we, Gregory?
He can’t hear, but I always talk to him as though
he could. I trust him with my secrets, Mr. Calthorpe.
They say dead men tell no tales; I say deaf
and dumb men tell no tales either. We understand
one another, don’t we, Gregory?” He looked without
seeing at the deaf mute who had listened without
hearing, aware only that Silas was speaking by the
movement of his lips. “One’s always sorry to have
told a secret,” Silas said, nodding at Calthorpe;
“always sorry sooner or later, but Gregory, my
brother, he’s safe with any secret. I only tell them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>to him. Never to Nan, and I never told one to
Hannah. Only to Gregory. All my secrets,” and
he fell silent, and began biting his lips, pressing
them between his teeth with his fingers, that were
surprisingly long and nervous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Calthorpe did not know how to answer; he looked
at Gregory’s wife, trying to establish a bond of
helpful sympathy between himself and her, the two
normal people in that room, but she immediately
looked away in her scared and nervous fashion.
Calthorpe then saw that Gregory was watching him
with a malicious sarcasm that startled Calthorpe for
a moment into the belief that he was actually grinning,
although no grin was there. Thus startled,
he began to speak, hurriedly, confining himself to
the practical.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, you must take some time off, Silas;
this week will be very trying for you, and very busy
too; there will be the inquest and the funeral.”
(“Why did I say that?” he thought to himself.)
“We shall all want to make it as easy as possible for
you, and the men will be glad to take turns at your
job. You mustn’t worry about that. Supposing I
give you a week?” Seeing that Silas’s lips curled
with what he took to be disdain, he thought that perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>his offer had been inadequate, and added to it,
“and your brother of course would be given the
day of the funeral, and if at any other time you want
him, Silas, you have only to ask me; I shouldn’t be
hard on you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We don’t want any time off,” Silas replied ungraciously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know that it is customary ...” said Calthorpe.
Customary! he clung to the word; it gave
him a sense of security. “It is customary,” he repeated,
“in the case of death, or sickness, or accident,
to release such near relatives as are employed
at the factory. You needn’t think you would be
accepting a special favour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why should I think that, Mr. Calthorpe?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Calthorpe knew from the instant defiance in the
blind man’s tone that he must make no allusion to
Silas’s disability; he said, “Well, the sad circumstances
of your wife’s death....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She brought me my dinner as usual,” said Silas
suddenly; “she sat with me in the shed while I ate it,
down by the railway, like she always did, because
afterwards she used to bring me back to my work,
and then carry the plate and things home. Just
like every other day. When I’d done she took me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>back and left me in the shops; I didn’t know anything
more. After I’d been there two or three hours
they came and told me. They said she’d been found
on the railway line. I don’t know how long she’d
been there, or why she didn’t start off for home at
once. Perhaps she’d been waiting for the fog to
lift; there was a fog to-day, wasn’t there? and anyway
I could feel it in my breath without her telling
me so. It was extra thick down on the railway.
Perhaps she waited for it to lift. Or perhaps she
was waiting to meet somebody in the shed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Waiting to <i>meet</i> somebody, Silas?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m a blind man, Mr. Calthorpe, and she was a
blind man’s wife.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Calthorpe saw that Gregory’s wife had ceased her
little clatter with the supper-things, and was standing
as though stupefied beside the supper table, her
fingers resting on its edge. Now she moved again,
setting a kettle on the range.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I knew nothing till hours after she left me—two
or three hours,” Silas reverted. “Nothing until
they came and told me. I’d been working all the
afternoon. She left me at the door of the shops,
Mr. Calthorpe,” he said; “she didn’t come in with
me.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“No, no; I see,” said Calthorpe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sometimes she’d come in for a chat; she was
friendly with my mates, friendly with Donnithorne
specially. He’d come here sometimes, Sundays,
wouldn’t he, Gregory? But to-day she didn’t come
in. No. She said she had a bit of mending to do at
home; that’s it, a bit of mending. She wanted to
get home quick.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then why should you think she waited to meet
anybody in the shed?” asked Calthorpe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s only my fancy; I’m a blind man, Mr.
Calthorpe; I couldn’t have seen who she waited for,
or who she met. Gregory could have seen. But <i>I</i>
couldn’t, and Gregory wasn’t there. You know he
works inside the factory, Mr. Calthorpe, and I work
in the shops down by the railway-sheds, tying up
the boxes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know; you’re a grand worker,” said Calthorpe.
He was afraid of Silas. He saw with relief that the
clergyman had come down from the upper room,
and was standing on the lowest step of the stairs
where they opened into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I knew nothing,” Silas went on with a rising
voice. “Funny, that a man’s wife should be lying
across railway lines, and the man not know it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Husband and wife should be one, shouldn’t they?
But I never told her my secrets. Women don’t
understand men’s secrets. I don’t hold with women,
Mr. Calthorpe, they’re lying and deceitful animals;
you can’t trust them out of your sight, and as I
haven’t any sight it stands to reason I can’t trust
them at all. But husband and wife should be one
all the same, so they say. Dutiful and patient and
faithful, that’s what women ought to be, but they’re
only artful. Perhaps I’ll be better without one.
I’ll get a man to share the house with me, and lead
me about when I need it; I know a nice young chap
who’d be glad.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>II</h3>

<p class='c010'>“My poor friend, your sorrow has thrown you off
your balance,” said the clergyman as he came forward
and laid his hand upon Silas’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s you, Mr. Medhurst?” said Silas, instantly
recognising the voice, which indeed was unmistakable.
“You’ve prayed over her; well, I hope
she’s the better for it. Heaven send me a parson to
pray over me when my turn comes, that’s all I say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My poor friend,” the clergyman said again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“pray rather to Heaven now that you be not embittered
by your affliction. Let us call forth our
courage when the test comes upon the soul; let us
pray to be of those whose courage is steadfast even
unto death. The lot of man is trouble and affliction,
and He in His Mercy hath appointed our courage as
the weapon wherewith to meet it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s a help, isn’t it, Mr. Calthorpe?” said Silas,
“that’s a great help, that thought. Is that what you
say, Mr. Medhurst, to a man that’s going to the
gallows? What do you tell him—to feel kindly
towards his jailers, the judge who condemned him,
the jury that found him guilty, the police that arrested
him, the man or woman he murdered, the
teacher that taught him, the mother that bore him,
and the father that begot him? You tell him not to
curse them all,—eh? You tell him to feel kindly
and charitable like you’ve told me to be long-suffering
under my blindness and to have courage now
my wife’s dead,—eh? you tell him that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am not a prison chaplain, Dene,” said Mr.
Medhurst, stiffly, removing his hand which, however,
he immediately replaced, saying with compassion,
“My poor friend, my poor friend! you are
sorely tried.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“There’s worse things than death, Mr. Medhurst,”
Silas exclaimed, and he sprang up as though the
clergyman’s touch were unendurable to him, and
stood in front of the range, having felt his way
rapidly across the room. Mr. Medhurst followed
him, but Silas heard him coming, and moved away
again, behind the table. Mr. Medhurst turned to
Calthorpe with a gesture of resignation, saying in a
low voice, “These poor fellows! we must be tolerant,
Calthorpe,” and Gregory continued to watch the
movements and gestures, which he could understand,
although he could not hear their speech. “Look
here, sir,” Silas began again, “I didn’t know of the
accident, not till hours afterwards, as I’ve been telling
Mr. Calthorpe,—is Mr. Calthorpe still here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Silas, I’m still here,” said the overseer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, I thought I hadn’t heard the door. Well, I
was in the shops, and they told me at five o’clock.
When they came to tell me, I asked what time it
was, and they told me, five o’clock. Now it was
two o’clock when I finished my dinner; I asked
Hannah, and she told me, two o’clock. That’s
three hours, sir. Mark that. She’d been on that
line three hours before her husband knew it. Is
that right, when husband and wife should be one?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“They told you directly she was found, Dene,”
said the clergyman. “No one is to blame.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m blaming no one,” said Silas sullenly, “I only
ask you to mark it, sir: three hours. Three hours
before I knew.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why does he insist on that point?” thought
Calthorpe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m alone now, a lonely man and a blind one.
The inquest now,—must you have an inquest?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We are all equal before the law,” said Mr. Medhurst
in a gentle and reproving voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I have to go to it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am afraid so, Dene.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ll tell them what I told you: it was three
hours before I knew. She was alive at two o’clock,
when she left me,” said Silas with great violence,
striking his fist upon the table and glaring round
the room with his sightless eyes; “you’ve all heard:
three hours,—you, Mr. Medhurst, and you, Mr. Calthorpe,
and you, Hambley, and you, Nan. Come
here, Nan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gregory’s wife went to him, like a dog to a cruel
master; he had thrust his fingers through his black
hair, and looked wild. He groped for her shoulder;
clutched it firmly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“Tell Gregory, Nan; tell him she had been dead
three hours before I knew.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gregory’s wife made swift passes with her fingers
to her husband, who read the signs and answered in
the same language.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He says you told him that when you first came
in, Silas.” She had a clear and gentle voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You hear that, Mr. Medhurst? you hear, Mr.
Calthorpe? I told my brother that when I came in.
I’m alone now; I had a son, but I don’t know where
he is; I had a daughter too, but she went soon after
her brother. I stand alone; I don’t count on nobody.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, Dene; I respect your sorrow, but I cannot
hear you imply that your children deserted you:
you were always, I am afraid, a harsh father.” Mr.
Medhurst spoke in the reprimanding tone that he
could assume at a moment’s notice; it was shaded
with regret, as though he spoke thus not from a
natural inclination to find fault, but from a pressure
of duty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why don’t you say that I was harsh to Hannah?”
demanded Silas. Mr. Medhurst made a deprecatory
movement with his hands; he would not willingly
bring charges against a man already in trouble.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“Why don’t you say so?” repeated the blind man,
upon whom the movement was naturally lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Since you insist,” said the clergyman, “I must
say that the whole village knew you were not always
very kind to your wife; in fact, I have spoken to
you myself on the subject.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I knocked her about; I’d do the same to any
woman, if I was fool and dupe enough to take up
with another one,” Silas said.</p>

<p class='c008'>His pronouncement left the room in silence; his
blind glare checked the words on the lips of both
the clergyman and the overseer; he still stood entrenched
behind the table, his sinewy hand gripping
Nan’s small shoulder, for she dared do nothing but
remain motionless, neither cowering away nor
moving closer to him, but keeping her eyes bent
upon the floor. An oil-lamp swung from the ceiling
above the table. Gregory watched them all in turn,
from his chair beside the oven; he was really grinning
now, and seemed more in the mood to defend
his brother’s quarrels with his fist than to take any
interest in the visible terror of his wife. Nor did
she appear to expect championship from him. She
had not thrown him so much as one appealing
glance. Living between the two brothers, she might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>almost have forgotten which of the two was her
husband and which her brother-in-law; in fact, it
had been whispered in the village that the mode of
life in the Denes’ cottage was such as to lead the
woman into that kind of confusion,—but those who
spoke so were the ignorant, who disregarded or else
knew nothing of the pride and jealousy of the
Denes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t knock her about so cruelly as the train,”
said Silas, laughing wildly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“O Lord!” Mr. Medhurst began, clasping his
hands, “look with mercy upon this Thy servant,
that in the hour of his trial....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Trial? what’s that?” cried Silas. “An inquest
isn’t a trial, that I’m aware?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“... that in the hour of his trial he may rise
above the sorrows of the flesh to a more perfect
understanding of Thy clemency....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s just babble,” said Silas, who was shaking
now with rage from head to foot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Save him, O Lord, from the mortal sin of profanity;
endow him with strength righteously to live,
bringing him at the last out of the sea of peril into
the calm waters of that perfect peace....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You so smooth and righteous, sir, I wonder it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>doesn’t shock you to see a woman battered in like
Hannah’s battered now; yet you went and said your
prayers over her; fairly gloated over her, perhaps?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look, O Lord, with mercy upon this Thy poor
distraught but faithful servant. Consider him with
leniency; mercifully pardon....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here,” Silas cried, “the Lord’ll hear your
prayers just as well if they’re put up from your
parsonage. This is my cottage, and my affairs are
my affairs; what I do, or what’s sent to me, and how
I take it, is my affair. I’ve always held that a man
was a thing by himself, specially when he’s in
trouble; he isn’t forced to be the toy of sympathy,
and of help he doesn’t want. Let me alone. I
don’t want your prayers, Mr. Medhurst. I don’t
want your holiday, Mr. Calthorpe. I’ll be at my
work to-morrow morning same as I always am—same
as I was to-day after my wife died, though,
mark you, I didn’t know it. I don’t whine, so I
don’t want you to do my whining for me. No. I
never missed a day at my work yet, and though I’m
blind I work to keep myself, and I’ll look after myself,
and my rights, blind as I am,—I’ll not be deceived,
not I. ‘Poor blind Silas.’ Don’t let me
hear you say that. Perhaps I know more than you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>think, and guess the rest.” He went off into a string
of mumblings, and a slight foam of saliva appeared
at the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s no good staying here, Mr. Medhurst,” said
Calthorpe, trying to get the clergyman away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You speak to him, Calthorpe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll try.—Here, Silas, you don’t hate me?” said
Calthorpe, going up to the blind man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No; you’re a well-meaning, ordinary sort of
chap,” replied Silas.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I don’t want to be anything else. Now see
here, if you think work will keep your mind off
things, you must come to work; but if you want to
stop away, you can stop away for a week. Is that
clear?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll come to work. A man’s got a right to decide
for himself, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course he has; but don’t be too hard on
yourself. Don’t get mulish. You don’t look right
somehow. You’re all out of gear; small wonder
just now, but you know as well as I do that you’re a
bit ill-balanced at the best of times. Take it easy,
Silas.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean well, I dare say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I swear I do; don’t say it so grudgingly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>See here: cling on to your political grievances, man;
they’ll take your mind off your own troubles.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know how to bear my own troubles.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m only giving you a hint; get angry over
something. Go down and make one of your speeches
to the debating society. I don’t share your views,
and I disapprove of your methods, because they
stir up trouble amongst the men, but I’d like to
think that something was helping you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Chatter!” said Silas suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re too damned scornful,” said Calthorpe
flushing. “All right then; fight it out with yourself.
Snarl at your mates, and scare the women. Make
yourself lonelier than you already are, you poor
lonely devil.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas laughed at that, and some of the hostility
went out of his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks, Mr. Calthorpe. I’ll be at work to-morrow.
Going now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Medhurst and I are both going—unless you
want us to stay?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I don’t want you to stay.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No ill-feeling, Silas?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“None, if you mean because you mislaid a bit of
your temper.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>III</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Nan opened the door for Mr. Medhurst and Calthorpe,
who passed out together and were immediately
lost to sight in the fog. In the winter months,
fog hung almost continuously over that low, fenny
country; white fog; billowy, soaking mist. Little
wraiths of it swirled into the kitchen as she opened
the door, so she shut it again quickly,—she did
everything quickly and neatly. For one moment
of panic she wished she could have gone with Calthorpe,
who was kindly, commonplace, and easy,
instead of remaining alone with those two violent
and difficult men, and the dead body of her sister-in-law
upstairs. She was weary of the strain that
never seemed to be relaxed in their cottage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Next time that canting parson comes here, I’ll
lay hands upon him,” said Silas.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will I get supper now?” asked Nan, trying to
distract him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a packet of folk we had!” Silas broke out;
“it was rat-tat at the door all the time, till the whole
village had passed through, I should say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Folks are kindly,” said Nan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Folks are curious,” barked Silas.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>She sighed, but, knowing better than to remonstrate,
resumed her question.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you have supper now, Silas?” and she repeated
the question on her fingers to Gregory.
“We’ll eat with you, Silas, to-night. Gregory and I,—we’ll
be there whenever you want us. I’ll do the
house for you, and your cooking. We’ll all eat together,
so long as you want us to.” She was gentle
and bright.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t want your pity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She busied herself with getting the supper out of
the oven, carrying the hot dishes carefully with a
cloth. Gregory watched her, pivoting in his chair
to follow her movements. Once he talked to her on
his fingers: “Don’t you take no notice of Silas; he
looks queer to-night,” and when she answered,
“Small wonder,” a broad grin distorted his dark
face. His bones and features, strongly carven, in
conjunction with the muscularity of his body and the
perpetual silence to which he was condemned, made
him appear like a man cast in bronze. He was,
moreover, singularly still; he would sit for hours
without stirring, his arms folded across his chest;
he never betrayed what he was thinking, but the
others knew that it was always about machinery.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Silas, on the other hand, was far more excitable; he
was always occupied; his mind had many trains of
thought which it pursued; Nan never knew which of
the two brothers she found the more alarming, and
life had become for her an uneasy effort to conciliate
them both. She had hesitated before speaking of
supper; meals seemed to accord badly with tragedy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas talked unceasingly; he talked with his mouth
full and many phrases were unintelligible. Now
and then he mumbled, now and then raised his
voice to a shout. He thundered assertions, and
spat questions at Nan. Gregory sat crumbling
bread and sneering at her distress. She was distressed
because Silas was in one of his most uproarious
moods, launching opinions on his diverse
subjects, every one of which readily attained the
proportions of an obsession in his mind; and she
was distressed further because she had all the while
the alienating sensation that her husband understood
his brother better than she did, although he
could hear no word. She sat between them, eating
very little, while they ate voraciously. She was
thinking of Hannah, who lay upstairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once she asked a question. “Who’ll you get,
Silas, to live with you now?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Linnet Morgan. He’s anxious to find handy
lodgings.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Linnet Morgan. That’s the chap newly in
charge of the scents? Would he live with just
working-people like us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the difference?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Nan could not define it. She had not intended a
challenge, but Silas had a trick of treating everything
as a challenge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s soft,” she said at last.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll learn not to be soft here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Towards the end of the supper, Silas fell into one
of his silences that were little less alarming than
his speech. He sat over the range, chewing his
pipe. Nan, having cleared away the supper, made
herself small with some sewing in a corner.
Gregory, looming hugely about the low room, disposed
his drawings on the table under the direct
light of the hanging lamp. They were on oiled
paper, pale blue, pale pink, and white; large sheets
of exact drawings of exquisitely intricate machinery.
He bent over them, handling pencils, rulers, small
compasses, and other neat instruments of his craft
with a certain and delicate touch. He had clamped
the drawings to the table with drawing pins, holding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>down the curling corners, smoothing out the shine
of the folds. He was lost at once in them, forgetting
both his own observant mockery and the
tragedy which had seized and shaken his relations
in its rough grasp. He was lost in his
silent world of smooth-sliding precision and perfection.</p>

<p class='c008'>His drawing was his hobby, not his profession;
he guarded it from the outside world as a secret, and
in the factory perversely clung to the meanest and
most strenuous physical labour. When his wife
protested—with more politeness than indignation—his
fingers ran in emphatic oaths. When his machines
were ripe to be shown, he would lay them
before the whole board of directors; yes, he would
startle those gentlemen; but until then he would be
a workman, wheeling the barrels of liquid soap to
the vats, beating and stirring it in the vats when it
needed cooling,—nothing more.</p>

<p class='c008'>He worked under the light of the lamp, making
here a dot of correction, there a measurement
of infinitesimal exactitude. His great fingers
touched as delicately as those of a painter of miniatures.</p>

<p class='c008'>The kitchen clock ticked in the stillness.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>IV</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Nan rose presently, heaping her sewing into her
large open basket. Her husband was still absorbed
in his drawings, and Silas in his meditations, over
which he muttered and scowled. He seemed
to be conducting an argument with himself, for his
lips moved, he nodded or shook his head, and tapped
his fingers upon his knee. Nan hesitated before
disturbing him. But she knew that she must warn
him before she left the room, for he could communicate
with Gregory only with difficulty. She
put her hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh? what’s that?” said Silas, starting; he had
been very deeply lost in his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going to our cottage for a bit, Silas, to put
things straight there; I’ll be back presently.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gregory’s here, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, he’s got his drawings out on the table.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas grunted, and Nan, after wrapping a muffler
round her head and mouth, let herself out of the
front door.</p>

<p class='c008'>In her own kitchen, which was identical with
Silas’s in the other half of the cottage, she stood
breathing with a sense of relief. Ah! if she might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>remain there! But she might not; Silas, who fought
all the time against her sympathy and her ministrations,
Silas, in spite of that ungracious ferocity,
was now dependent upon her and could not be forsaken.
Responsibilities by a cruel irony thrust
themselves upon her weakness. She, who had so
much need of protection, must protect.</p>

<p class='c008'>She must not idle here.</p>

<p class='c008'>She began rapidly clearing away the disorder of
the day, raking out the fire, and drawing the short
curtains across the little windows. She took her
husband’s boots into the scullery at the back of the
kitchen, and set them ready to be cleaned the next
morning. She went upstairs with a candle, turned
down the bed, drew the curtains there too, and
tidied the dressing-table. Through the partition in
the next cottage was, she knew, a similar bedroom,
and in that bedroom, where Silas and Hannah had
slept every night for twenty-five years and where
Hannah’s two children had been born, the remains
of Hannah now lay, covered over with a sheet, and
Hannah, brawny, loud-voiced, tyrannical towards
her sister-in-law, bullied by Silas, at times sullen
and at times nosily recalcitrant towards him, would
no longer go about the house as a working-woman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>her sleeves rolled up, an apron over her dress, clattering
pails and mops, ordering stray children off
her whitened doorstep. Nan had not loved Hannah,
but she thought it horrible that Hannah should be
lying through that thin partition, in the disfigurement
of which the men had whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>She wished that she dared arrange to sleep in
another room, but Gregory would be angry.</p>

<p class='c008'>She finished her work as quickly as she could
and returned to Silas’s cottage; only a couple of
yards separated front-door from front-door, but,
shivering, she pressed her muffler against her
mouth to keep out the fog. The light and
warmth were welcome again as she slipped into
the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas had not heard her. Gregory had his back
to the door and did not see her. He was still bending
over his drawings, all unaware that Silas stood
near him, speaking, a wild and reckless look upon
his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can’t hear me, Gregory, old man. Old
brother Gregory, wrapped up in your drawings!
How much do you know, hey? How much do you
guess? <i>I</i> did it—you know that, hey? She laughed
at me—with Donnithorne. She played the dirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>on me—with Donnithorne. I hated her, but I’ve
got my honour to look after. I shan’t tell anybody,
only you, old man. Tell you I did it—hey? Don’t
tell anybody, Gregory!”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>Calthorpe and Mr. Medhurst had entered into a
conspiracy to spare Silas from attending the inquest.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they walked away from the Denes’ cottage
together, in the fog, they did not speak for some
time. They were turning the same thoughts over
in their minds as they paced side by side down the
village street, seeing the lights in the windows on
either hand very dimly through the fog. The lantern
which Calthorpe carried, swaying, lit up a pale
milky circle but cast no forward ray. They were
chilled; little drops of moisture gathered on the
clergyman’s eyebrows and on Calthorpe’s brown
beard; their very footfalls seemed to be muffled by
the fog.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was warmer in Dene’s kitchen, Calthorpe!”
said the clergyman at last, handling his chilblained
fingers tenderly, and then beating his hands together
in their thick woollen gloves.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“Yes, sir, but I’d sooner be out here than in that
unhealthy sort of atmosphere,—like that poor little
woman. I think, if you ask me, the fog was thicker
in that room than it is out here. I scarcely liked to
come away leaving her there. I never saw any one
look more out of place. And so resigned, too; never
a thought of revolt. But not glum, not pulling a
long face; that’s what touched me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No doubt she enjoys sufficient philosophy and
religion to accept with a brave fortitude the lot she
has herself chosen,” said Mr. Medhurst.</p>

<p class='c008'>Calthorpe, who had been feeling slightly exalted
and full of a chivalrous emotion, the novelty
of which surprised him agreeably, thought that
Mr. Medhurst laid hands of lead upon a
butterfly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I thought there was something <i>lighter</i>
about her than that, somehow,” he said, struggling;
but as the clergyman remained rigid, with a compassionate
murmur of “Poor soul!” he turned to
another subject. “Silas Dene seemed more excitable
than usual, sir; they are strange fellows, those two,
and you never know how they are going to take
things. Silas’s readings work upon his mind; he’s
full of queer theories. No doubt you’ve noticed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Mr. Medhurst. First he’s off on one hobby-horse,
and then another. Politics, death, women, fate,
science, even poetry—he’s got his views on them
all; not lukewarm views, or ready to listen to argument,
as you or I might be, but loud, aggressive
views, and contradiction only makes him angry.
He fairly bullies the village; I don’t know how he
does it, but all the chaps are too much afraid of him
to turn upon him.” Calthorpe came at last with a
rush to the real point he had in sight, and said, “I
thought his manner more than usually queer to-night;
queerer, I mean, even than the circumstances
warranted?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes; his irreverence—I might almost say his
blasphemy—was very painful to hear; but we must
remember, he is sorely tried.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Calthorpe grunted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wasn’t considering it, sir, only from the point
of view of the church,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had reached the little gate leading to the
Rectory, and Mr. Medhurst stood with his hand on
the latch. The breath of the two men eddied like
smoke in the fog above the pallid light of Calthorpe’s
lantern. Mr. Medhurst repressed his desire for the
shelter of his own study, inhospitable as it was; so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>faint a stirring could scarcely be dignified by the
name of desire, but such as it was he repressed it,
recognising an enemy; personal inclinations were
allowed no place in a life of monotonous mortification;
his conscience ordered him to remain out in
the raw evening until Calthorpe had finished saying
whatever he might have to say, so he remained.
Suavity, patience, tolerance, impartiality; above all,
no self-indulgence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Calthorpe?” he prompted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That man’s not in a fit state to attend an inquest,”
the overseer brought out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah. No, perhaps not,” said Mr. Medhurst, and
then, startled, “You don’t mean....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good gracious, sir, I don’t mean anything,—only
to spare the man. It’s a clear enough case of accident,”
muttered Calthorpe. “I’m only afraid he’ll
lose his head if he’s brought to the inquest; begin
to rant on all his pet topics, do himself harm very
likely; be talked about; give a bad name to the factory;
perhaps lose his job. The Board is very
particular. And I can’t help having a liking for
Silas Dene; he’s a sound worker, he’s full of pluck,
he doesn’t drink as many men would under his
circumstances. I can’t help having a respect for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>man. He’s something out of the ordinary. Can’t
we keep him away from the inquest, Mr. Medhurst?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Unfortunately, he was the last person to see his
wife alive.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think I can get round the coroner, sir, if you’ll
back me up.” Calthorpe was quite eager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will certainly lend you my support,” said the
clergyman rather dubiously. “After all, it is a clear
case of accident, as you say, and the inquest will
only be a formal affair. I suppose it is really a
clear case,” he added, “but his manner was very
peculiar.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There now, sir,” said Calthorpe, pouncing on
him, delighted to have proved his point, “you know
Silas Dene as well as I do, and we both trust him,
yet, having seen him in this state, you’re aware of
the beginnings of doubt; what about the coroner,
who comes out from Lincoln, and has never heard
of Dene or his record before? I tell you, we must
keep the man away. It’s only decent, only Christian.
The man’s blind in more ways than one; we must
see for him, and keep him from hitting his head
against a wall.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No doubt you are right; I’ll help you. Send
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>for me when you want me, Calthorpe; good-night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-night, sir; thank you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Calthorpe hurried away with his lantern into the
fog; Mr. Medhurst let himself in at his front door.
He wondered whether he had been too hasty in
leaving Calthorpe, whether he ought not to have
inquired more thoroughly into the overseer’s exact
meanings. Had his wish for creature comfort relaxed
the vigilance he kept over his conscience?
In any case, it was too late now for regrets. With a
sigh he laid his coat, his clerical hat, his muffler and
his gloves on the sideboard in his narrow hall, and,
passing into his study, held a match to the gas-jet
above his table. A small pop of explosion resulted
in a thin blue flame. No fire burnt in the grate; Mr.
Medhurst never permitted himself a fire until seven
o’clock in the evening, and by the clock he saw that
it was only half-past six. He blew upon his fingers,
trying to warm them. For a few moments he knelt
in prayer for guidance at his black horsehair sofa,
then, rising, he drew his chair up to the writing-table
and began to deal, methodically, with a pile of his
papers. He had pigeon-holed Silas Dene already
in the files of his mind.</p>

  <div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>II</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Silas Dene came to the inquest in spite of Calthorpe’s
intervention, Mr. Medhurst’s collaboration,
and the coroner’s acquiescence.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had agreed not to come; he had been surly
and ungracious, but finally had given his consent
and had even added a word of conventional gratitude.
He had given a written affidavit, which was
read at the inquest before his arrival. All evidence
had been taken, that of Dene’s mates, of the driver
of the truck-train,—the fog had been very thick at
the level-crossing, and he couldn’t see five yards
ahead of him,—that of the shunters who had found
the body lying across the rails. All had gone
smoothly in unbroken formality; the inquest was held
in the village concert-room, with the body lying next
door; Calthorpe was there, Mr. Medhurst, a representative
of the board of directors, and many of the
factoryhands who out of curiosity had interpolated
themselves as possible witnesses; the proceedings
were nearly over, and the verdict about to be pronounced,
when after a fumbling at the door Silas
Dene appeared suddenly in the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was alone, and in the unfamiliar room he
stood stock still, solitary, detached and startling;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>isolated as a man who has vast spaces around him,
regardless of the cheap pitch-pine walls that actually
confined him. He was bare-headed, in his working-clothes,
as rugged as the bole of a storm-wrecked
tree on the borders of a great plain. All gazed at
him, and the coroner ceased speaking.</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas broke the silence to say, in a restrained but
threatening voice,—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is this the inquest?—I came here by myself,”
he went on; “I was in the shops. I know Mr. Calthorpe
persuaded me not to come. Then I changed
my mind. I thought I’d like to hear for myself.
Will some one take me to a place?”</p>

<p class='c008'>They were amazed at his feat of travelling unescorted
from the shops where he worked, to the
heart of the village, and mysteriously this achievement
increased their fear of him, enriching it with
a bar of superstition. Calthorpe led him to a central
chair, near the coroner, so that he stood in the middle
of the room, with his hand on the back of the chair.
He would not sit.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is very irregular,” said the coroner, “I know
of no precedent for this, but of course there is no
reason why Dene should not attend the rest of the
inquest if he wishes. There will be no need for me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>to call him as a witness now; he attends as a spectator
only. Dene, your affidavit was read earlier in
the proceedings.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to speak,” said Silas.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If there is anything you want to say, Dene....”</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas stood erect at his full height, ignoring the
chair to which he had been led; he had on his most
truculent expression. Calthorpe was dismayed, but
knew his own impotence. There was a natural
force in Silas that was not to be thwarted. He made
other men seem puny; only his brother Gregory
matched him, and Gregory was not there.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to hear the verdict returned first, if
you’ve reached it,” said Silas.</p>

<p class='c008'>The coroner shrugged his shoulders, annoyed and
perplexed, then said,—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps that would be as well. With the returning
of the verdict the inquest is over, and anything
you may like to say afterwards will be in
the nature of a private address, not one held in a
coroner’s court.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He put the usual questions, and a verdict of
“Death by Misadventure,” was returned, with a rider
of sympathy to the widower “in the peculiarly sad
circumstances of his bereavement.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“Death by Misadventure,” Silas repeated slowly;
everybody listened in greedy anticipation; the accident
and the inquest both provided succulent material
for the curiosity of the vulgar, and to batten
upon the exposed passions of a fellow-being—and
that fellow-being a Dene!—was an excitement, a
treat, albeit an alarming treat, full of surprise and of
that quality of danger never very far removed from
all manifestations of the Denes. The audience bent
forward, with a slight rasping of chair-legs on the
wooden floor; they gazed at Silas as though he
were an animal at bay, devouring him all the more
shamelessly that they knew he could neither see
them nor read the unthinking hunger on their faces.
He was the centre of mystery and alarm in the village,
emerging from his darkness and seclusion only
to terrorise. Celebrated as an orator at the village
debating society, the men never knew whether to
regard him as a leader, an enemy, or an ally. But
here his heart, and not his theories, was concerned!</p>

<p class='c008'>His first words startled them beyond their hopes
of gratification,—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you so sure?” He had intoned, but now,
seeking effect with the skill of a natural speaker,
he dropped his voice a full octave as he swung out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>into the current of his theme, “It seems to me a
paltry sort of thing, to die by misadventure. A paltry
ending, to be taken away willy-nilly, like a brat
from a party! Why, a man might be leaving many
things incompleted, many things he had set his heart
on doing before he died. Death by misadventure!
I wouldn’t set much store by the man that couldn’t
look after his own life better than that, owning
himself the sport when he ought to be the master.
It’s a shameful thing to be beaten. It’s a shameful
thing to give up your right of choice. Death by
misadventure! a blunder, a clumsy mismanagement,
a failure to carry through to the end, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His audience was amazed at the scorn he contrived
to infuse into what was, to them, nothing but
a trumped-up thesis. They could not admit that this
unexpected, unnecessary, far-fetched thesis could be
anything other than trumped-up. Even Silas Dene,
full of surprising opinions as he was, could not,
with the longest plumb-line, have discovered such
an opinion as this anchored in the wells of his heart.
He must be joking at their expense—deluding himself,
perhaps, in his effort to delude them. A practical
joker, Silas; even, it would appear, over his
wife’s body!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>He had paused after his preamble, gathered all
his thoughts up into his grip, and began to deal
them out to his audience.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Suicide, now—there’s nobility in that. That’s
grand. That’s escape; true escape from a prison.
The man who doesn’t care a damn for his own life
is no prisoner. I call him the contemptuous man.
He’s a conquerer; he’s free. How many of you have
got that freedom? and how many have got snivelling,
timorous little spirits that cling on to their
miserable breath as a treasure? So long as you do
that you’re bound slaves and prisoners. There’s no
escape for you.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re angry? I shouldn’t bait you and gibe at
you? Every one of you is man enough to live up
to my principles? Well, the floods are out; they’re
handy; there’s nothing to prevent any one of you
from proving his manhood and his independence.
The floods over the fields, and there’s the Wash for
anybody who’d like something a bit deeper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He launched this invitation at them with a trivial
insolence. “He’s mad,” they said, and shrugged,
crossing their arms in resignation, but they were
troubled for all that; he was poking fun at them, a
grim kind of fun, and their annoyance increased as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>they remembered his superiority over them: one
couldn’t answer Silas Dene, he had read too many
books, he returned fire with too many arguments
and quotations. He stood there now, apparently
ready to go on talking for ever, his only difficulty
abiding in the variety of his topics, which to choose
and which to discard. A little smile played across his
lips as he paused, mentally turning over his wares,
and surveying the audience which he could not see.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s suicide. I see no reason why the man
who, so to speak, has always got his finger on the
trigger of his revolver and the muzzle of the revolver
tapping between his teeth, should fear any pain
or hazard. He has his way of escape always open.
But there’s a braver man than that,” he said loudly,
“the man who abstains from the death he doesn’t
fear. Not from religion, not from thoughts of the
hereafter; simply from contempt of the easy path.
Too proud to avail himself of the remedy he has
at hand. All of you who have troubles,” he said,
pointing his finger at them and letting it range from
side to side, sweeping across their rows as they sat,
“wouldn’t you like to shake off those troubles by the
easy way? never to suffer any more? to leave the
responsibility to others?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>They could scarcely believe that a few minutes
previously he had been inviting them to cast themselves
into the floods.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should roar with derision at the man who killed
himself to escape his pain,” he went on, as though
possessed by a demon of mockery, a cold demon that
enjoyed goading their bewilderment. Mr. Medhurst
frankly thought him diabolic; Calthorpe wondered
whether he was in his right mind. “I have the
right to speak of it,” he exclaimed, suddenly angry;
“I spend my life in darkness; let any one dare to say
that I have got no right to speak of pain! I don’t
complain or ask for pity; I don’t want pity, I’ll fight
against pity so long as I have breath, your pity
insults me. But I can speak, because I know death
as well as any man who has once stood on the gallows
with the rope round his neck and been reprieved
at the last moment. I’ve leant across the border
like one leans across a ditch, and touched fingers
with death, and then drawn back my hand. You
can’t say as much. But shall I tell you something?”
he added sombrely. “I mistrust myself, whether I
have that true freedom; am I truly the contemptuous
man? I wonder! but I wonder without very much
confidence.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>They were impressed, and as he ceased speaking
they remained very still; the men thought “Poor
devil!” and the women shivered. Calthorpe saw
that Nan was straining forward in her place, her
breath coming quickly, and her eyes full of tears.
As she caught his glance she murmured, “Oh, can
no one get him away?” but Calthorpe shook his
head, for Silas had already begun to speak again.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>III</h3>

<p class='c010'>“That’s for suicide, and that’s against suicide,
and the more you think about it the more you’ll
be obliged to think about it. Then there’s another
thing to think about and talk about: murder.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This time his audience was really startled; Nan
gave a cry, and Calthorpe saw that she had grown
pale, and that deep lines had appeared at either corner
of her mouth. He made a movement to go
and sit beside her, but at the same time Linnet Morgan
shifted into a chair just behind her, and whispered
to her over her shoulder, so Calthorpe
remained where he was. Mr. Medhurst got up and
pointedly left the building. The coroner coughed
and said, “Really, Dene, you know....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought you told me, sir,” said Silas in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>most insolent manner, “that this would cease to be a
coroner’s court after the verdict had been returned?”
The coroner made no answer to this, but began
turning over his papers in order to conceal his annoyance,
and after waiting a minute Silas continued,
“Murder.... No one will deny that there’s as
much courage in murder as in suicide. Oh, not in
the actual fact, I grant—many of you would say
there’s no courage, but only a sort of brutal cowardice,
in murdering a man unawares, or worse still
in murdering a woman,—no courage needed to push
a woman under a train!—no, there’s no courage in
the actual fact, but what about the forethought of
it? the first idea, the scheming and the planning,
the daily watching of the chosen victim, hey? you
must come to a grand pitch of hatred before you can
look at warm living limbs and think ‘I’ll turn you
to the cold of death!’ Life’s great; I’ve a great
respect for life. Life’s rich and warm and manifold,
and lies outside the bestowal of man. That’s
why I’ve so high a regard for life: there’s wealth in
it, that we can’t bestow the same as we can take
away. That’s why I say there’s courage in murder
just as there is in suicide,—courage in assuming
that liability.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“And consider the afterwards,—the courage in
keeping silent afterwards. The man would be living
with a secret that took him by the arm as he walked
down the street, whispering in his ear, and that
snatched bits off his fork at meal-time as he lifted
the fork to his mouth,—a playful familiar secret.
It’d jolt his elbow at the first sign of forgetfulness.
It’d come out with him on Sundays, jaunty....
He’d know that by a word he could turn his invisible
mate into a visible thing for every man to see. The
deed wouldn’t be finished with the moment the deed
was done. Oh no! Crime would be easy enough to
the man who had no memory. But memory has
long wiry fingers to prod us under the ribs....</p>

<p class='c008'>“Soberly,” he continued changing his voice, “let
us think: it would be simple for any one to murder
my wife. They could do it in my presence; I’m
blind; I should be none the wiser. Let us suppose
that, after she left me at the shops that day, some one
had seized on her and dragged her away towards the
level crossing; she could have held out her arms
towards me for rescue, but I should have known
nothing—nothing! That’s all perfectly plausible.
But who should have had a sufficient grudge against
my wife? I’m going through the names....”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>A real protest was about to be raised against this
hideous entertainment, when a commotion arose:—Nan
Dene had fainted.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>IV</h3>

<p class='c010'>“Not surprising!” said the woman in commiseration,
peering at her where she lay on the floor,
“pore little soul!” “Better get her home,” said the
men, and meanwhile the representative of the directors’
board took Silas firmly away from the hall.
“Where’s Gregory?” asked some one; “At the factory,”
some one else replied, and Calthorpe, pushing
through the throng, said “Here, let me carry her.”
“Mr. Morgan’s got her, sir,” said a voice, and Calthorpe
saw Morgan rising from his knees with Nan
drooping limply in his arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Great indignation was expressed against Silas as
the factoryhands came in little groups out into the
street. In the wan January sunlight Nan was already
being hurried away in Morgan’s careful clasp
towards her own cottage, followed by two women.
Silas was on the opposite side of the street, his back
against a house, in an attitude of defiance, talking to
the director, who looked restrainedly indignant. Silas
called out suddenly, pointing with his finger across
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the street, “Oh, I can hear you whispering! why
not say it out loud: Silas Dene ought to be suppressed?
but I’ve been a good friend to you in
strikes and troubles, and it’s always been, ‘Get Silas
Dene to speak for us.’...”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, hush, Dene!” said the director; “you’re
not quite yourself; walk up and down with me for a
little.” He took Silas by the arm and forced him to
walk up and down, talking to him all the time in an
earnest and persuasive undertone. The men and
women lingered in their groups about the concert-room
door, whispering together and watching Silas,
but Calthorpe came amongst them and ordered them
away. He was peremptory and irritable as they had
rarely seen him.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>The fog persisted, turning the world to a strange
and muffled place, and seeming by its secrecy to
favour the evil deeds of men. Within its shroud a
man bent on dark purposes might creep unobserved
by his fellow-beings. It could be imagined to breed
such purposes, as miasmic places breed fantastic
lights and unwholesome growths. It was the more
oppressive because it had no tangible weight; only
the moral weight, and the obscuring of vision. It
was a foul-playing foe, insidious and feline, not to
be lifted by strength, or countered by resistance.
It was stealthily horrible, as the destroyer of clarity,
setting itself mutely but quite implacably against
all bright and manifest things, against the proclamation
of the sun and the sweet glory of the breeze.
Like an influence that intentionally confuses clear
thought and strong endeavour, discolouring all that
is pure, fostering all that is obscure and fungoid, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>made more difficult the road of the traveller, and,
waiting ever outside the doors of houses, tried to
slip in its unwholesome presence through any crack
of door opened to admit it. It wreathed strangely
around the corners of houses so entered. The inhabitants
of Abbot’s Etchery spoke of it as a living
thing. “He’s terrible thick to-day,” they said, or
else, “He’s not thinking of going away from us as
yet.”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>II</h3>

<p class='c010'>On the higher ground beyond the marshes the air
was clear from fog. Here were knolls surmounted
by clumps of beech-wood, the ground beneath the
trees rusty with last year’s leaves, and the trunks of
the beeches themselves bare, lofty, and processional,
their clubbed heads shaven against the winter sky.
From these knolls one looked down over the brown
mirror of the floods, that surrounded the block of
the village with the factory and the ancient abbey,
and that were crossed until the eye lost it in distance
by the great dyke carrying the road and the
perspective of stark telegraph poles. But this was
only when the fog had lifted. When the fog lay
heavy, one looked down upon a white plain of cloud,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>blackened by a great smear and a fading trail where
the smoke of the factory-chimneys rose to mix with
it (the chimneys whose summits sometimes reared
themselves through the fog like three giant fingers),
and concealing beneath it who could tell what stress
and labour, what hope or suffering, what secrecy
of purpose, what web of mingled and obscurely tending
lives?</p>

<p class='c008'>On the higher ground amongst the beeches stood
the big Georgian house belonging to Malleson, a
director of the factory and local squire of the district.
It was built to turn its back upon the flooded
region, and from the front windows and colonnaded
façade the view stretched away over the gentle rise
and fall of the midland country, the dun fields,
clumps of bare trees, grey sky, and cawing rooks,—a
landscape in dead and uneventful levels. Malleson
was very well satisfied with it. His wife
was not. Malleson found satisfaction in the
dark tangle of the sleeping hedgerow and
the dying brake, and was happy if with
gun and spaniel he might wait at the top of a ride
for the bolt of a rabbit, or might stand watching
woodcutters at their cleavage, and, passing on, come
upon a plough-team of his own horses straining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>across the shoulder of a hill under a wide heaven.
He was content to lean over a gate looking across a
bean-field, for so long a while that, like some animals,
he took on the colour of his surroundings; a
hare ran amongst the beans, sat listening upon its
haunches, then ran again a little farther; a jay
flashed blue between two clumps of hawthorn,—but
Malleson, whose interest was professional, and who
would never have owned to a more sentimental
satisfaction, did not like jays in his woods any better
than the presence of hares among his young beans.</p>

<p class='c008'>Christine Malleson, his wife, hated the country,
hated the Midlands, hated Malleson Place, Malleson’s
spaniel, Malleson’s friends, Malleson’s relations,
clothes, politics, point of view, position in the
county, religion, appearance, conversation, and occupations.
The only thing she liked about him was
his money. In very early days, fifteen years ago,
before she knew better, she had given him a son;
but in the horror of that one experience,—which
had, progressively, infringed upon her comfort, outraged
her vanity, terrified her nearly out of her wits
in one brief concentrated nightmare, and finally
drawn down upon her the irony of Malleson’s joy,
and of remarks designed to please her, smiling, congratulatory,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>immemorial, consecrated, fatuous,—all
that had taught her never to allow the experiment
to be repeated. The months that Malleson obliged
her to spend in the country were one long sulky lassitude;
she rarely set foot beyond the garden, and in
cool weather spent her days in overheated rooms;
discontented and fastidious, picking up a book, reading
the beginning, and, if that interested her, turning
to read the end, but always too languid to read
the middle; sleeping on her sofa after luncheon,
resting after tea, amusing herself by frequent change
of clothes, sometimes staring out of the window
while her be-ringed hand held back the muslin curtain,
watching for the post that might cheer her
by bringing some phrase of flattery or homage,
after which event remained only the long empty
hours before she found herself, arrived there by
some monotonous law of routine, sitting at dinner
opposite Malleson.</p>

<p class='c008'>She never listened to what he said, and indeed
when they were alone he spoke very little. She
usually leaned her head upon her hand as though
she were weary, a head of lovely shape, drooping
gracefully; and picked at burnt almonds, or held a
cigarette to her lips, for she had a habit that maddened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Malleson, of smoking almost throughout a
meal. It maddened him, yet he owned that his
wife was a very graceful woman, sitting there languid,
spoilt, indefinably but flowingly dressed, a
woman unlike the wives of other country squires,
and within his very scrupulous heart he contested
that he preferred her thus, that a woman was designed
as an ornament, not for the sturdier business
of companionship. He knew that she despised him,
and, humble, accepted her estimate, ranging himself
low, not putting into the opposite balance the esteem
in which men held him. Having long since ceased
to think that his conversation might attract her
attention, only his loyalty withheld him from admitting
to himself that he looked forward to the
relief of the moment when she would nod to him and
trail out of the room, and he might throw his legs
over the arm of his chair with a pipe and a book
until he began to reflect it was time for him to go
to bed.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>III</h3>

<p class='c010'>She listened to him, however, while he told her
about the inquest he had that day attended. She
had volunteered an inquiry, and when he said in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>mild surprise, “My dear, it never occurred to me to
mention it, because I know you don’t care much
for the factory,” she replied, “You may as well tell
me,” thinking how little discrimination he showed
between the things that might interest her and those
that could not possibly be expected to do so, “Emma
said something about it while I was dressing.”
“Gossip, of course,” he said, restrained but displeased,
and she shrugged and murmured, “Prig....”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the end he told her, though without enthusiasm;
and the story stirred the rather stagnant pool
of her curiosity. One or two of his phrases, pronounced
meditatively, had put her on the scent of
something unusual, something that might while
away a portion of the dreary time, though calling
for very little effort on her part,—she could not endure
the idea of effort. “He speaks like an educated
man,” her husband had said of the blind factory-hand,
“or a great deal better than most educated men
speak, and I believe he is entirely self-taught. It
appears that he has a hunger for books.... And a
born speaker, like some of those ranting parsons
one hears sometimes talking to a crowd from a tub.
All the makings of a demagogue. I should like to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>assist at one of his performances at the debating
society; Calthorpe gives me to understand that
they’re remarkable. He’s full of ideas—Utopian
mostly—exposes them ably, works them out in both
scope and detail, convinces his audience, or at any
rate stirs them—and then demolishes the whole
fabric—out of pure devilry. I wonder what the
fellow’s mind is like inside? A black business, I
should fancy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have heard of him before,” said Lady Malleson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I dare say he is merely a disgruntled Socialist,”
said Malleson, who was already ashamed of having
been led away into such speculative wordiness.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>IV</h3>

<p class='c010'>In the waste of hours, after that, she found her
thoughts revolving constantly around her preconception
of Silas Dene. At first she smiled indulgently
to herself when she encountered that unknown
but quite definitely conceived figure, again erect and
motionless in the foreground of her mental vision;
then she grew resentful of the unknown man who
so imposed himself upon her attention, like a grave
and persistent apparition, bending upon her his unfaltering
gaze. So long as he remained an evocation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>she could toy with him; fit theories on to him,
like an artist draping a lay figure. She diverted
herself greatly by thinking him out at leisure, ordering
and re-ordering the procession of her ideas; it
was true that she had heard but little about him,
yet her theories were clearly formulated: he must
be a self-conscious man, humorously so perhaps,
(she was not yet certain on the score of his humour,
trying whether she liked him best with or without
it), but in any case alarmingly so; but whether he
had control over the trend of his life, as would seem
to be indicated by his raising himself by his own
effort above the intellectual level of his class, or the
trend of his life over him, she was unable to decide.
Was he that being for whom in her discontented,
languid, tentative way she always sought,—for in
her endlessly renewed hours of idleness she dallied,
not unintelligently, with a little practical philosophy,—was
he, might he be, that being who lived in perfect
consciousness, viewing each incident of life
in instant proportion, not condemned to wait for
the slow drawing out of years into perspective, but
calm, secluded, not so inhuman as to escape the
passing ruffle of moods, nor so unreceptive as to
escape the stimulus of new influences, but on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>whole sternly planned, continuous, progressive,
working towards a goal, not drifting towards some
end unknown and concealed within the uncertainty
of mists? This apprehension, this quality of being
aware, was by Christine Malleson so greatly envied,
because it was in herself so totally lacking. What
did she upon earth? what track would she leave, did
she hope to leave? she could not have replied. Would
she find in a blind factory-hand that rarest illumination,
flung like a straight ray along a dark road,—clearness
and wholeness of vision? She knew without
being told that he would prove a man of strong
opinions; that much might be said of many men,
but would he have taken the further step, and
welded the scattered material into a system, that
could be a weapon of defence or offence, a pix so
ably constructed as to appraise the worth of coin
both large and small? Was he of that calibre? She
thought, potentially yes. She raised her cigarette
to her lips, watching the slim blue trail of smoke
that rose without wavering in the warm air of the
draughtless room. Silas Dene, surely, smoked a
pipe, of pungent black tobacco, and along with the
specific picture of him ramming in the shreds, she
played with the idea of herself as the wife or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>mistress of such a man; he would be the experiment
in a fine but natural metal, dross and dirt mingled
with the gold of the nugget. She allowed herself
to drift with the current of this amusement; she was
alone, none could read her thoughts, a new luxury
was precious to her appetite wearied by ennui, and
she had the frankness of acknowledging to herself
her craving for any new sensation. She smoked in
long inhalations, more concerned with the thought
of what she might do to Silas Dene than with the
apprehension of what Silas Dene might do to her.
She would like to bewilder that man. She would
like to test his arrogance, break it if she could. She
would like to prove to him that his control of life
was based upon no true security. It could not be
so based; no poor human could be truly immune.
They might think themselves immune until the storm
came along. Should she play this experiment, under
the guise of Lady Bountiful, on Silas Dene?
Should she indulge her curiosity at his expense? The
first unseemliness of the idea passed away with surprising
ease. He would help her to get through
the weary country months. She had tried her hand
at most things, this would be something new; something,
therefore, amusing....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>Calthorpe came often to see the Denes after the
inquest; no one could have been kinder, more considerate,
or more attentive than Calthorpe.</p>

<p class='c008'>No doubt the Denes would have preferred to keep
out Calthorpe, as they had kept out every one else,
but he was the overseer, and they tolerated him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He came on Saturday afternoons, on Sundays,
and sometimes on ordinary week-days, during the
evening.</p>

<p class='c008'>He would spend a little time talking to Silas, and
then he would knock at Nancy’s door and ask her
for confidential information.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nobody can tell me so well how Silas is getting
on as you can, Mrs. Dene,” he would say; “may I
come in for a minute?” or else “would you stroll
down the road?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Nan never strolled down the road, but she always
let him into her kitchen and gave him a chair beside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the fire. Sometimes her husband was there, sometimes
he was not, but in either case he could not
affect the conversation. Nan told Calthorpe one
day how it had taken her a little while to become
accustomed to the disabilities of the brothers, and
to remember that whereas Silas could hear and
speak but could not see, Gregory could see but could
neither hear nor speak.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I used to stop and think; now of course I know
without thinking. And really you wouldn’t believe
how one can get on with Gregory: I talk to him
with my fingers like I talk to you with my tongue,
it’s no bother. He’s very quick, too, at understanding.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Calthorpe had already noticed that she never lost
an opportunity of praising her husband and advertising
her own contentment. She was more reticent
about her brother-in-law, and when once Calthorpe
asked her why, she replied after a slight hesitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silas can speak for himself; he doesn’t need
any one to speak for him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He can certainly speak!” said Calthorpe. “Do
you remember how he startled us all at the inquest?
why, by the time he’d finished, half the folk were
wondering whether they shouldn’t throw themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>into the floods, and the other half whether they
shouldn’t go home and strangle their families!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the first time he had directly mentioned
the inquest to Nan, and he did so now in full recollection
of the effect Silas’s speech had had upon her.
He had hesitated long over the problem whether he
should ever allude to it or no, but recognising the
subject as the shadow always in the background of
their talks, he had decided to attack it openly, his
intent, as usual, kindly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s worried you a good deal, I know,” he added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh,” she began,—he knew that little “Oh,” by
which she prefaced her remarks and which always
betrayed her nervousness,—“Oh, I don’t think we
ought to talk about it, do you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean, you don’t want to talk about it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She got up in a restless way, and busied herself
with a vase of wild flowers upon the dresser, turning
herself so that her face was hidden from him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Dene, you don’t want to talk about it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, don’t <i>drive</i> me, please,” she murmured, in a
voice full of distress.</p>

<p class='c008'>Calthorpe was very remorseful to feel that he had
been the cause of this distress, and he came over
to the dresser where she stood arranging the flowers.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“Very well; of course we will never speak of it
again,” he said, trying to soothe her, but knowing
that if his repentance took too affectionate a form
she would immediately shy away from him. “What
are you doing with those flowers? look, you have
upset some of the water! here’s my handkerchief
to mop it up with.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she took the handkerchief he saw that there
were tears on her cheek, as clear as the drops of
water she had spilt from the flowers; but with his
large, rough tact he pretended not to notice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where did you find so many flowers, this time
of year? Primroses in February! Catkins, of course,
and grasses, and a sprig of plum blossom....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And some wild violets,” she said, showing him.
“Smell them, how sweet!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I wish I had somebody like you to put
flowers about my place,” he said in a rush of
sentiment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you take these? Yes, please!” crushing
them, all wet as they were, into his hands. “I got
them in a copse over by Thorpe’s Howland last
Sunday, I walked over there....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What, by yourself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, with Silas and Mr. Morgan; it was Gregory’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Sunday on at the factory. We started after
dinner, Silas was in a good temper, and I was happy
to get away from the floods for a bit. You know,
there’s a belt of higher ground away there to the
south, which never gets flooded. It was nice to see
the green again, and to go through woods where
the trees didn’t stand with their roots soaking and
rotting in water. I hate the floods, they’re so cruel;
cruel in a dull, flat sort of way.... Gregory likes
them; they make him grin. Of course, Silas can’t
see them, but if he could I’m certain he’d like them
too; he’s always asking me to tell him just what
they’re like. But that Sunday he’d forgotten about
them. He was as cheerful as could be, repeating
poetry all the time as we went along the lanes; he
kept stopping and saying “Now listen to this!” and
waving time with his stick as he recited, and Mr.
Morgan kept capping what he said, and they laughed
a lot, trying to outdo each other.” She smiled at the
recollection, leaning with her back against the
dresser; then Calthorpe saw the smile disappear
from her lips as though at another darker remembrance,
and the scared look came into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well?” he prompted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh. Well, then we went on till we got to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Thorpe’s Howland, and we made Silas sit under a
beech-tree while we looked for primroses....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You and Linnet Morgan?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I and Mr. Morgan. Silas sat under the tree
for a bit, pulling up the moss all round him; then he
got up and leant against the tree-trunk, saying more
poetry; Shakespeare, I think it was. Mr. Morgan
beckoned to me to come and listen, so we crept up on
tiptoe, and Silas went on like that for about half an
hour; I don’t know how he manages to keep it all
in his head. I don’t like it so much when he starts
his poetry in the kitchen, but in the wood it seemed
all right; it might have been part of the wood,” she
said, lowering her voice and hanging her head with
her pretty, sudden shyness, and scrutinising her
finger nails.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you mean: part of the wood?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,—there was a lot of patchy sunlight on the
ground, coming through the trees, and the moss that
Silas had torn up smelt bitter,—like earth,—and the
primroses smelt soft and sweet. There was the sort
of big sand-pit in the bank, where we had picked
them. There were the trees, so gray and naked.
There was Silas,—Mr. Morgan whispered to me that
Silas looked like a tree himself, a tree that had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>been blasted by lightning, and when he said that,
I saw he was right; even Silas’s arms, waving about,
were like the branches.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, well!” said Calthorpe, scratching his chin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Morgan’s like a son to Silas already,” she
went on; “he’s gay with him, and he’s as gentle as a
woman. He’s never put out by Silas’s ways—never
seems to notice them, in fact. And Silas likes him
because he can talk to him by the hour about all the
things he thinks about and reads about.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Silas always talks to everybody.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, he’s so greedy for an audience that he’ll put
up with never getting a sensible answer, sooner than
not talk at all. But Mr. Morgan’s got education;
he’ll argue with Silas; he’s like a whetstone to a
knife. He’ll get Silas into a proper excited rage, and
then laugh, and Silas takes it in good part. It was
a grand day when he came to live in the cottage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,—well, I must be going,” said Calthorpe,
moving away, and he went after a rather sulky
good-bye, very unlike his usual friendliness and
promises to come again.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>II</h3>

<p class='c010'>Nan stood still, with a finger to her lip, after he
had gone, then she opened the door and ran quickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>after him. He heard her steps, and her voice calling
his name and, turning, he saw her, a bright flushed
spot on each small cheek-bone, with strands of dark
hair blowing across her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Mr. Calthorpe, I haven’t offended you, have
I?”</p>

<p class='c008'>(“How tiny she is, and how concerned she looks!”
he thought, and nearly laughed with tenderness.)</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bless me, no, my dear!” he said, patting her arm
as one might pat a child’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m so glad; I was afraid ... you went away
so suddenly.... You forgot the flowers; here, I’ve
brought them.” She held them out, and continued
to look anxiously up into his face. “Sure I didn’t
say anything to offend you—sure?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure! you’re very sweet,” he said, taking the
flowers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve been so kind; I think you’re my best
friend,” she said impulsively, and she put her hand
on his cuff. “I must go back now—but you’re not
cross, are you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a bit; not in the very least.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He walked away shaking his head rather ruefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She won’t come for an ordinary stroll with me
of an evening, yet she tears after me without a hat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>or a coat, all upset, for anybody to see! She’s got
a good heart.... She’s never herself when those
Denes are about. But when she’s herself she’s just
as sweet as she can be. Poor little thing! Am I a
fool to go there?” and thinking these thoughts he
hurried on, carrying the flowers she had given him.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>III</h3>

<p class='c010'>He continued, however, to go there, but he made
his visits more rare, reflecting, with a shade of
surprise at his own considerateness, that it would be
doing her a bad turn to cause gossip in the village.
He was, after all, the overseer, while she was only
the wife of a factory-hand and a factory-hand herself,
so that he could not visit the Denes as another
man might, on a footing of equality. The death
of Silas’s wife had given him an excuse at first for
frequenting the double cottage, but that affair was
now a month old, and was already beginning to be
forgotten in the rude world of the factory-village,
where accidents were more or less common. Silas
himself never alluded to it. He seemed, as Nan had
said, to live in comparative content with Linnet
Morgan. Linnet Morgan was young, educated, and
extremely clever; and so merry that Silas’s dark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>moods usually ended by being dispelled before his
laughter. Linnet Morgan seemed, in fact, to have
taken charge of Silas’s life.</p>

<p class='c008'>So much, Calthorpe thought, for Linnet Morgan.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Nan,—ah! Nan was winning and tantalising,
demure sometimes and sometimes impetuous; Nan
was shy but confiding; little and sweet and windblown;
and Calthorpe tried to feel large and fatherly
towards Nan. She evidently welcomed him, gave
him his chair by the fire; then went about her occupations,
stopping to chatter when she felt inclined,
asking him his opinion with her pretty head held
on one side and her hands on her hips, singing over
her work,—adopting him very much, in fact, as an
inmate of her household. This method might put
him at his ease, but it also mortified him. She accepted
his visits with a lack of self-consciousness,
he sometimes thought, that would have been mortifying
to any man. He supposed that Gregory was
fond of her, but the difficulty of communicating
with Gregory rendered too tedious the effort of
discovering his thoughts. Calthorpe usually nodded
pleasantly to Gregory, and left their acquaintance
at that. He thought Gregory a sneering, sour kind
of fellow, jealously wrapped up in his machinery;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>he would not let Calthorpe look at his designs, but
covered them over with both hands outspread, when
once the overseer bent with a friendly interest over
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Nan,—no, never had Calthorpe blundered
across so delectable a being as Nan. He cursed
himself for having hitherto overlooked the grace
and delicacy which set her so apart from the other
working women; he cursed himself anew each time
he watched her as she hung muslin curtains across
her windows, or arranged and re-arranged her wild
flowers upon the dresser. He had to make his observations
for himself, for she told him nothing; she
did not tell him how she wilted daily as she passed
through the factory on her way to her own work,
which lay among the heaps of white powder and
the myriads of little scent-bottles, and was congenial
to her,—soft powder, coloured boxes, gilt
labels, pretty cut-glass, and a constant rainbow of
ribbons. She snipped them with her scissors, sitting
on a high stool before the table, in company with
rows of other girls, all in blue overalls; and the
ends of ribbon fell in a scatter of confetti around
her. She noticed everything that the other girls
did not notice. They only lifted their heads to gape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>at the visitors who were being taken over the factory,
but Nan, gentle, uncommenting, and inwardly
blandished, dwelt with pleasure upon the bright
lightness of the big room, upon the pale sunlight
that fell on the bent heads of the girls,—some of
them had fair, sleek hair that looked like spun silk
in the sun,—upon the powdery cleanliness of the
floor, and the scrubbed expanse of the tables between
the armies of shining little bottles. She hated the
rest of the factory, that smelt and smoked and
clanked; but this one room approached her secret
vision of diaphaneity and seemliness.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>IV</h3>

<p class='c010'>For who amongst men and women lives without
the secret vision of some spot, either known or
merely conjectural, whether of red moors or sheltered
meadows, mirrored coasts or battlemented
mountains? Hers was a pitifully simple dream.
Sun and water, and always light: light everywhere,
streaming and pouring in, because light to her meant
happiness. The house must be small, the rooms low;
size alarmed her. She would be too timid to dwell
beneath vaulted roofs. In her mind she knew its
geography intimately, and the disposal of its garden;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>it stood in the heart of undulating cornlands,
not very far from the sea. She had never seen it.
And with whom she shared it she did not know.
Certainly not with Gregory. Gregory’s exclusion
was not deliberate; it was unthinking, and, had it
been put to her in words, might have perplexed and
dismayed her; nevertheless, it was a fact that Gregory’s
step never sounded upon the tiles of her dream-passage,
nor did his belongings lie in the litter of
joint-proprietorship about the rooms.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>V</h3>

<p class='c010'>Instead of this she was given flooded, low-lying
country, a dark and ancient abbey, and the clanging
factory served by fire and iron. She shuddered at
the cranes which discharged the coal from the slow
canal-barges of the factory’s private canal. She
compared the barges to beetles, and the cranes that
poised above them, to the pincer-armed antennæ of
some gigantic spider, descending to devour. When
they pivoted slowly with their dangling burdens,
she shrank, thinking that the cable must break,
either from accident or mischief, and drop the
weight upon the men below. She thought the factory
would relish that. She never went near the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>canal wharves or the railway line if she could possibly
avoid it, but sometimes she had to take Silas to
the “shops”—the packing sheds where he worked,
and which were near the railway. He seemed often
to ask her to take him there since Hannah had died,
and on the way there he would talk about the accident.
Nan was unable to answer. She led him
conscientiously, holding her black shawl about her
head with her free hand, and turning her profile
away from him; but though she was careful of his
steps she could never force an answer between her
lips. No, not if she had known that he would guess
his secret had been surprised; nothing could have
loosened her response,—yet her terror of him was
extreme. She had often to constrain herself from
crying out. He walked boldly, really knowing the
way without her guidance, and talking in a loud
voice, swinging his arms, so that sometimes people
stopped to stare at him. He rehearsed and repeated
every detail of that day, making a grievance that he
had not known of his wife’s death until three hours
after its occurrence, and Nan shuddered, wondering
how he could infuse so much vehemence into a lie.
Had he perhaps persuaded himself of its truth? But
she little knew the rotations moving in his brain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>that dwelt upon the murder as a vindication of his
own cunning and courage. That was a deed planned
and executed by no bungler and no coward! He
delighted fearfully in its elaboration. With every
phrase he was risking a slip, as a man walking in a
dangerous place risks his limbs with every step.
True, he held Nan in contempt, but she did well
enough for him to practice on; any suspicion that
might raise its head in her mind could easily be laid
again by his inventive brain. And after she had
left him, he felt flattered and gratified by his own
daring.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>VI</h3>

<p class='c010'>A coward! was he a coward? Surely a blind man
had very little choice; deeds of danger were debarred
from him, but Silas dwelt amorously upon such
deeds—courage pre-eminent amongst the high attributes
that fascinated, baffled, and angered him.</p>

<p class='c008'>By a twist of his brain, through his blindness,
courage meant light. Courage shone. It allured
him, so that he turned constantly round the image.
There was nothing moral about this allurement, it
was as pagan as any cult of beauty. Courage moreover—physical
courage—carried with it the thought
of death, which to his egoism was so supremely and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>morbidly entrancing. That he should cease to be?...
he could never adopt this idea. He went up
to it, and fingered it, but its clammy touch revolted
him, and he violently rejected it always. But he returned
to it again and again, working back his way
in a roundabout fashion, disguising the phantom
under a rich cloak of phrases.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>VII</h3>

<p class='c010'>He was scarcely more wary in his dealings with
Lady Malleson than with Nan, not that he underestimated
her intelligence, but because she awoke
all his boastfulness, pandered to it, stimulated him
as nobody had in the whole of his highly experimental
life. The comparative frequency of his
interviews with her was kept strictly secret. It was
now no longer Nan who led him to Malleson
Place, as on the first occasion, but Hambley, whom
Silas had terrorised into discretion. Nor did those
meetings invariably take place in the house, but
sometimes in a summer-house, away from the gossip
of the servants, while Hambley was sent to
skulk about the park, with orders not to return
before an hour, or two hours; and even once, when
Sir Robert was in London, Hambley was dismissed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>until midnight. He offered no objection; the employment
was after his own heart, and Lady Malleson,
unknown to Silas, made it well worth his while.
He knew that he was safe enough over this. When
the lady brought Silas to the garden gate, and gave
him over to Hambley, Silas could not see what
passed between her hand and Hambley’s. He could
not see Hambley’s grin of thanks, or his lifted cap,
or Lady Malleson’s nod of smiling complicity that
enjoined silence. He could only stand by, waiting
to be led away, during the little farce that was never
neglected:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, good-night, Dene; so glad you’re getting
on well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-night, my lady; thank you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-night, Hambley. Take care of Dene going
through the park.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my lady; good-night, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then they would turn and go, Hambley leading
Silas with care, while Christine Malleson re-locked
the garden gate and watched them, always reluctantly,
out of sight.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>VIII</h3>

<p class='c010'>That first occasion!</p>

<p class='c008'>She had long resisted the impulse to send for him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>How long? She did not know; every day had been
a week, since the wish first consciously awoke in her.
What had deterred her? she did not know that
either; perhaps a superstitious shrinking, an instinct
that the amusement might turn to a wild beast of
danger as soon as she exchanged the tractable wraith
of her own evoking for a human creature of independent
intentions, of will and muscle. So she had
prolonged the period of evasion, knowing perfectly
well that at the end of the road she was descending
with such restrained, deliberate footsteps, stood the
figure of Silas, with folded arms, waiting for her.
Sometimes she had wondered whether the whole
thing were not the creation of her fancy. The matter
had grown in her mind, since she had first heard
from her husband the story of the inquest, until the
blind man now accompanied every moment of her
day; and so strong was this fateful companionship,
that she believed Silas, down in the village, must
be living in equivalent consciousness of her nearness
and the rapid convergence of their lives. Still she
attempted to persuade herself that her own idle mind
was alone responsible; sometimes with a laugh,
sometimes with a shrug, she had tried to dismiss the
too persistent figure.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>She had not believed her own lips when she heard
them giving the order to fetch Silas Dene.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>IX</h3>

<p class='c010'>When they came to tell her that he had arrived
she had glanced at herself in the mirror, then remembering
that he was blind, she thought, “Absurd!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is with him?” she asked the servant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A young woman, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well; give her some tea in the housekeeper’s
room. Bring Dene up here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She lay on her sofa, waiting for him to be brought
up. She hoped his blindness was not disfiguring,
and suddenly the matter lost its almost mystical
value, and she saw it in a prosaic light: why had
she been so foolish as to obey her whim and send
for this man? she knew that she was very unskilled
at talking to what she called “common people,”
even when she came across them accidentally, such
as gardeners; they were always taciturn and hostile,
and she thought vaguely that they would be more
so within four walls even than in the open air.
The prospect of being closeted in her sitting-room
alone with a factory-hand,—he was nothing else,—appalled
her. Perhaps he would spit. Perhaps he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>would smell.... In any case, what should she
find to say to him?</p>

<p class='c008'>He was there, standing by the door where the
servant had left him, with the special stillness of
the blind in a strange place. Contrary to her
expectation, he did not wear a beard. She saw at
once that he had an extraordinary proud, fine-featured
face, and that his blindness was not in the
least disfiguring. Indeed, his eyes were so dark and
so full of fire that it was hard to believe them sightless.
He had nothing of the smartened-up appearance
that she was accustomed to associate with the
poor when visiting the rich. He had so clearly
taken no trouble either to brush his hair or change
his coat, that she remembered with a twinge of
annoyance her own glance into the mirror when
his arrival was announced. Her embarrassment
diminished as she realised that he was himself
neither intimidated nor impressed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Dene,” she said, “I am glad to see you. Sir
Robert has been telling me a little about your
circumstances, and I wondered whether I could
help you in any way? So I asked you to come up
here to speak to me.” She was satisfied with her
opening, but felt the last phrase to be weak, a falling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>away; his quietness, and the knowledge that he
could not see her, disconcerted her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In what way did you mean exactly, my lady?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>How could she answer that question? Mention
of money was impossible; she knew that already,
although she had only heard him pronounce nine
words. She was driven up against the truth that
she had wanted to see him for no other purpose than
her own distraction, that any other reason would
be a mere pretext, and she had a swift impulse to
tell him this, confident that he would not misunderstand.
So much already did she feel him to be not
only her social, but also her intellectual equal.
(Social was a wrong word, an absurd word; it could
never be used, with all the artifice and fallacy that it
implied, in connection with Silas Dene. Her discoveries
went rapidly. But she must give some sort
of answer.)</p>

<p class='c008'>“I meant nothing exactly. I thought that if there
was anything I could do, you would tell me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is the first time, my lady, that I remember
your sending for any one from the factory up to
Malleson Place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was astonished at that; his tone amounted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>to an accusation. He was so grave, and she used
in her mind the word “chained,” as most nearly
expressing his obvious reserve of force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The truth is,” she said, ceasing to lie at full
length upon the sofa, and sitting upright, “that I was
very much interested in what Sir Robert told me,
and thought I would like to see you for myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As your ladyship has seen me now,” he suggested,
“and there is nothing I want, I can go?”</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as he wanted to go, she wanted him to
stay. She got up and came to help him, saying,
“But I should like to talk to you for a little, Dene;
give me your hand and I will take you to a chair.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He shook his head, and said that he preferred to
stand. She had to go back to her sofa thwarted,
though in so small a thing, while he remained by the
door. He made her sitting-room appear tawdry,
with its little gilt chairs and lacy cushions and pink
carpet, so much did he rob people and objects of all
but their true significance. She was almost ashamed
of her surroundings, and was thankful that he could
not see them, but she thought that it would take
more than mere blindness to stay his more perilous
vision down through the embellishments into anybody’s
soul. She was conscious of saying to herself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“This <i>won’t do</i>,” and of taking herself sharply in
hand. “This is to be <i>my</i> game,” she insisted, “not
his.”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>X</h3>

<p class='c010'>She had failed entirely to make him sit down, for
he continued to refuse her invitation with the same
haughty gravity, and responded not at all to the one
or two phrases with which she tried him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have heard reports of your fame as a public
speaker, Dene,” she said with a propitiatory smile,
forgetting for the moment that her smiles were
wasted on him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A lot of the chaps speak, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But without your advantages. Sir Robert tells
me you are a very highly-educated man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No such luck, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, come, Dene? Sir Robert says you are a
great reader.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Somebody must ha’ been kiddin’ Sir Robert, my
lady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She delighted in him. He was perfectly grave,
and affected a Lincolnshire accent, which he certainly
had not possessed when he first came into
the room; a subtle insolence, but one which she did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>not resent, for it demonstrated him as unwilling to
prance out his tricks, cheaply, at the bidding of a
sophisticated curiosity, and she was a woman who
knew how to esteem superficial, although perhaps
not fundamental dignity. (Malleson had fundamental
dignity, which, poor man, had not served
him to very much purpose with his wife.) Also,
she was emphatically a woman who maintained that
the first duty of sex in the game was to be a danger
to the opposite sex. Dene—certainly Dene fulfilled
both these conditions! Acquaintance such as hers
with him was like a sojourn at the foot of a volcano
which might at any moment erupt. She relished
the peril of the game. How she stirred him to
extravagance after extravagance! how she poked
and probed and decoyed his mind! encouraging,
insinuating, blowing upon the ready spark; “baiting
Silas Dene,” she called it, as a baron might have
said, “baiting the bear”; all the better sport because
she knew it to be so quick with danger. She sent
for him as often as she dared, and when he was
absent she thought about him, but always as an
experiment, an intellectual exercise. She was too
cold-blooded a schemer to allow herself to think of
him now as anything else....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>Nan returned frequently along the road on the top
of the dyke, on the red and gray February evenings,
when the stillness was absolute; on either side of
the dyke the floods lay, placid and flat as mirrors,
over broad miles of country, reflecting the crimson
sun up a path of roughened and reddened splendour.
The water-filled ruts along the road glowed with the
same light; long narrow lines of fire. How dismal
that flooded land would have been without that
light; gray, only gray, without the red! All the most
dismal elements were present: a few isolated and
half-submerged trees stuck up here and there out of
the water, and at intervals the upper half of a gate
and gate-posts protruded, the entrance to some now
invisible field; useless, ridiculous, and woebegone.
But that red light, cold and fiery, scored its bar of
blood across the gray lagoons.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>The village lay in front of her, at the end of the
road, and behind the village rose the three high
chimneys of the factory, black amongst the gray
waters, the gray sky, threatening and desolate in the
midst of desolation. The three black plumes of
smoke drifted upwards, converged into a large
leisurely volume, and dispersed; already in the
dusk the red glow at their base was becoming visible,
and a single star appeared high above them, as
though a spark that had floated out from the heart
of the factory now hung suspended in supercilious
vigil. The abbey on the farther side lay heaped in a
mass as dark as the mass of the factory. Nan would
shift to the other hand the basket she was carrying
home from the market-town of Spalding; walking
along the elevation of the dyke, she made a tiny,
upright figure in the great circle of the flat country,
for here the disc of the horizon was as apparent as
it is at sea. The group of village, factory, and
church, emerged like an island loaded with strange
and sombre piles of architecture, adrift from all
other encampments of men. Abbot’s Etchery lay
before her, against that formidable foundry of the
heavens, that swarthy splendour of smoke and sunset,
and as she continued to advance she thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>that she re-entered an angry prison, too barbarous,
too inimical, for her to dwell beneath it, and live.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>II</h3>

<p class='c010'>The calm, cold weather broke late in February;
a gale swept for two nights and a day across the
country, beating up the waters into little jostling
peaks and breaking from the forlorn trees branches
that were jerked hither and thither upon the waves,
now coming to rest upon a tussock of higher ground,
now taken again by the shallow storm of the floods,
or tossed to lie against the bulwark of the dykes.
The smoke from the factory chimneys was snatched
by the wind, and swirled wildly away in coils and
streamers, black smoke mingled with the dark
masses of cloud that drove across the disordered
sky. Gulls from the Wash flew inland,—the gulls,
that more than any other bird attune themselves
to the season, in summer gleaming white, lovely and
marbled, on the wing, but in times of tempest
matching the clouds, iron-gray, the most desolate of
birds.</p>

<p class='c008'>It became unsafe for carts to travel along the
road on the top of the dyke, since one farm-cart,
swaying already under an excessive load of fodder,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>was caught by a gust of wind and overturned. After
one moment of perilous balance, it crashed down the
embankment, dragging after it the two frenzied
horses, falling in a welter of broken limbs, tangled
harness, and splintered woodwork, while the trusses
of hay broke from their lashings and scattered into
the borders of the flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The storm of wind and water raged round this
disaster, and folk from the village collected on the
top of the dyke to gape down at the carter busy
amongst the wreckage, and surreptitiously at Malleson,
the owner, who stood alone, more in sorrow
for his valiant horses than in regret over his material
loss. There was no hope of saving the horses,—they
were shire horses, stately and monumental,—by
the time the crowd had assembled their tragic
struggle had already ceased. The carter was sullenly
bending down, unbuckling the harness; he would
speak to no one. On the top of the dyke the gale
buffeted the little crowd, so that the men (their
hands buried in their pockets, their overcoats blown
against their legs as they stood with their backs to
the winds, and their mufflers streaming) stamped
their feet to keep themselves warm, and the women
with pinched faces drew their black shawls more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>closely round their heads and whispered dolefully
together.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>III</h3>

<p class='c010'>The accident greatly excited Silas Dene; it
occurred on a Saturday afternoon, and Nan, who
was sewing in her own kitchen, heard upon the wall
the three thumps that were Silas’s usual summons.
She found him with Linnet Morgan, Hambley,
and Donnithorne, one of his mates, who had
stopped on his way down the street to bring the
news.</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas wanted Nan to go to the scene of the accident
and to bring him back a first-hand report. She
cried out in dismay, appealing with her eyes to both
Morgan and Donnithorne. Hambley she ignored;
his very presence made her shudder, and she knew
he would side with Silas.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Silas, I wouldn’t for the world! Those
poor horses—what are you asking me to do? to go
and gloat over them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sentiment!” said Silas, who was angry. “Linnet
says the same. God, if I had eyes to use....
There’s violence and destruction half a mile down
the road, and you won’t go to see it. It maddens me,
the way you folk neglect the gifts and the opportunities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>God offers you. Sentimentalists! A fine
rough smash-up ... the wind’s a poet. A poet, I
say, wasting food and life for the mischief of it.
The food of beasts, and the life of beasts; wasted!
There’s twenty trusses of hay in the floods, so
Donnithorne here tells me,—twenty trusses spoilt
for dainty-feeding cows,—and two fine horses
smashed, and a big wagon. They’re lying heaped
at the bottom of the dyke. There’s blood spilt, as
red as the heat of the sun. No man would dare to
bring all that about for the sake of the mischief; but
the wind’s a poet, I say—I like the wind—he tears
up in a minute trees that have persevered inch by
inch for a thousand years, and sends to the bottom
ships full of a merchant’s careful cargo. Well, you
won’t go down the road and tell a blind man about
the smash?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guts spilt, Mrs. Dene!” said Hambley, rubbing
his hands together and provoking her. She turned
away from him with repulsion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ye’re morbid, Silas,” said Donnithorne in disgust,
his hand on the latch. He was a red-headed,
red-bearded man, with pale but lascivious blue eyes
that once had leered at Hannah, Silas’s wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Morbid, am I? no, it’s you squeamish ones that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>are morbid, and I that have the stout fancy. If
Heaven had given me eyes! I wouldn’t be such a
one as you. I’d sooner be a fool playing with a bit
of string, and crooning mumble-jumble, or taking
off my hat to a scarecrow in the dusk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With that he bundled them all out, and slammed
the door.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>IV</h3>

<p class='c010'>Linnet Morgan followed Nan back into her own
kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Mr. Morgan, is Silas mad?” she said, turning
to him at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I sometimes don’t know what to make of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would he go to look at the accident, do you
think, if he could see?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not he!” said Morgan, “not he! But he’s safe
to say so. He turned pale when Donnithorne told
him about it, but next minute he was pretending to
be all eager, like you heard him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They remained standing, occupied with their own
thoughts. Gregory glanced up from his drawings
as they came in, but otherwise took no notice of
them. Morgan sat down before the range, and
began prodding a piece of firewood between the
small open bars.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“I lose my bearings, living with Silas,” he said
presently; “amongst all his manias, he’s got this
mania for destruction. Perhaps the long and short
of it is, that he likes talking loud about big noisy
things, when he’s certain they won’t come near him
to hurt him. Being blind keeps him safe.... Mrs.
Dene, come for a turn with me. You look right
white and scared. Come out, and let the wind blow
away bad thoughts?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll ask Gregory to come with us.” She went
over to her husband, touched him on the arm to
attract his attention, and spoke to him on her fingers.
“He says he’s busy with his drawings, but will we
go without him.”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>V</h3>

<p class='c010'>They took the road that led in the opposite direction
from the accident, and uncharitable eyes
watched them go past the windows of the houses in
the village. But they walked all unconscious, feeling
relieved and with a gay sense of holiday, almost a
sense of truancy; and when the wind caught them
as they left the shelter of the village, and forced
them to a breathless standstill, they laughed, and
struggled on again, exhilarated by their fight against
so clean and natural a foe. They were soon in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>open country, having left the village behind; they
breasted the wind, and breathed it deeply, tasting,
or fancying that they tasted, upon their lips the salt
of the flying spray. The road which they followed
lost the monotony of its straightness when they
conquered it yard by yard, and remembered that,
did they but follow it far enough, it would lead
them eventually to the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was indeed a regal splendour about the
day, about the embattled sky and driven clouds.
The northern forces had been recklessly unleashed.
The sea would be beaten into a tumult full of angry
majesty. How wild a day, how arrogant a storm!</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>VI</h3>

<p class='c010'>Coming back, the wind almost forced them into
a run, and they yielded, racing along the road,
impelled as by a strong hand. They could not speak
to one another in the midst of the turmoil, but they
smiled from time to time in happy understanding.
As they neared the village Nan checked herself, and,
leaning breathless against one of the telegraph-posts
that bordered the road, tried to re-order her hair,
but the wind took her shawl and blew it streaming
from her hand, also the strands of her hair in little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>wild fluttering pennons. Nevertheless, she was in
such high good humour that she only laughed at
what might have been an annoyance, turning herself
this way and that to gain the best advantage over
the wind. Morgan stood by, laughing himself, and
watching her. She wore a dark red shirt, and the
wind had blown two patches on to her cheeks,
which were usually so pale they looked fragile and
transparent. They continued more soberly towards
the village, still without speaking, even when they
reached the shelter of the street, because it seemed
unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>They saw Silas standing on his own doorstep,
hatless, in a strange attitude, holding his hands
stretched out before him, the fingers wide apart.
Nan ran up and caught one of his hands; Morgan
was surprised, for she never treated Silas with
levity. She seemed to have shaken off the years of
repression, to have forgotten totally the conscientious
lesson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you doing standing there, Silas?” She
was very gay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Letting the wind whistle in my fingers. Hark!
Bend down your head.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t hear it, Silas.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“No, you’ve coarse ears; eyes! eyes! yes! but
coarse ears. Where have you been?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Along the dyke....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Seen the accident?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, Silas; you shan’t dwell on that.” Morgan
had never seen her so brave, so radiant, with the
blind man. She took his arm now, leading him
back into his cottage. “Sit down by the fire, Silas;
it’s warm and sheltered in here. The kettle’s singing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d sooner stay in the wind,” he said, striving
against the light pressure of her hands on his
shoulders as she held him down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The wind’s too rough; I’ve had enough of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then let me stay on the doorstep alone. You
stop in the shelter with Linnet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Silas, we’ll all three stop in here together.
I’ll sing to you a bit, shall I?” Morgan observed
her firmness with a surprised admiration.</p>

<p class='c008'>She got her zither from the cupboard where she
kept it, laid it on the table, and tried the chords
with a little tortoiseshell clip that she slipped over
her thumb. The thin notes quivered through the
bluster of the wind and the harshness of Silas’s
voice. She bent intently over her tuning, trying the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>notes with her voice, adjusting the wires with the
key she held between her fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now!” she said, looking up and smiling.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sang her little sentimental songs, “Annie
Laurie,” and “My boy Jo,” her voice as clear and
natural as the accompaniment was painstaking. She
struck the wires bravely with her tortoiseshell clip.
Morgan applauded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s grand, Mrs. Dene.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why do you choose to-day for your zither?”
Silas asked in his most rasping tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s Sunday, Silas,—a home day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you’re not home; you’re in my cottage;
your home is with Gregory, next door. You’re here
with me and Linnet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gregory can’t hear me sing,” she said pitifully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then why don’t you dance? he could see you
dance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I asked him to come for a walk,” she said, her
brightness dimmed by tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And he wouldn’t go? with you and Linnet?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, he was drawing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah?” said Silas. “But Linnet went with you?
Linnet wasn’t busy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’ll I sing that pleases you?” she said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>maintaining her endeavour; “‘Loch Lomond?’
You used to like ‘Loch Lomond.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ask Linnet; he’s Scotch; no doubt that’s what
put a Scotch song into your mind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silas!” she said in despair, dropping her hands
on to her zither, which gave forth a jangle of
sounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you want home, as you say, stop here with
Linnet; I’ll lend you my cottage,” said Silas, rising
and groping for his cap. “Play at home for a bit.
Draw the curtains, light the lamp, make tea for
yourselves, put the kettle back to sing on the hob,
and you, Nan, sing to your zither to your heart’s
content. It’s a pleasant, warm room, for pleasant,
warm people. Home of a Sunday, with the wind
shut out! Oh yes, I’ll lend you my cottage. Gregory’s
lost in his drawings till supper-time. Stay here
and talk and smoke and sing, while the room grows
warmer, and you forget the wind and the two dead
horses and spoilt fodder lying down the road. Spend
your evenings in forgetfulness. Ask no questions
of sorrow. Kill darkness with your little candle of
content.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re crazy; where are you going?” cried
Morgan.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Only to the Abbey,—not into the floods,” Silas
replied with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To the Abbey? alone?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“One of my haunts, you know.”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>VII</h3>

<p class='c010'>Silas found his way along the village street by
following the outer edge of the pavement with his
stick; as he went he snorted and muttered. “I’ll
have nothing to do with Nan’s kindness,” he said
to himself several times. “She’s easily satisfied;
she’s comfortable; she’s grateful. She shuts the
eyes that she might see with.” This thought made
him very angry, and he strode recklessly along,
knocking against the few folk that were abroad on
that inclement evening. One or two of them stopped
him with a “Why, Dene! give you a hand on your
way anywhere?” but he rejected them, as he was
determined to reject all comfort and patience that
Nan might offer him. He liked the wind, that opposed
him and made his progress difficult; he struck
out against it, the struggle deluding him into a reassuring
illusion of his own courage. He welcomed
the wind for the sake of that tortuous flattery....</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>He would have made his way to Lady Malleson,
but he was afraid to venture under the trees in the
park, where a bough might be blown down upon
him.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>VIII</h3>

<p class='c010'>At the end of a side-street the Norman abbey rose,
black and humped and semi-ruined, the huge dark
clouds of the evening sky sailing swiftly past the
ogive of its broken arches. The village had retreated
from the abbey, because the abbey’s furthermost
walls were lapped by the floods, so that it
remained, the outer bulwark of man’s encampment
upon the inviolate mound in the midst of the
inundations; it remained like some great dark derelict
vessel, half beached upon dry land, half straining
still towards the waters. The street which led to it
was a survival of the ancient town, gabled and
narrow, with cobbled ground; Silas tapped his way
over the cobbles. He could not see the enormous
mass of tower and buttress and great doorway,
that blocked the end of the street before him, but he
heard the scattered peal of bells, and the deep gloom
of the abbey lost nothing in passing through the
enchantment of his blind fancy. He entered, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>was swallowed up in shadows. The roof was lost
in a sombre and indistinguishable vault. The aisles
became dim colonnades, stretching away into uncertain
distance. The pillars with their bulk and gravity
of naked stone dwarfed the worshippers that rustled
around their base. The organ rumbled in the transept.
Silas moved among the aisles, handing himself
on from pillar to pillar; he imagined that he moved
in a forest, touching his way from tree-trunk to tree-trunk;
he conceived the abbey as illimitable, and
relished it the more because ruin had impaired the
intention of the architecture.</p>

<p class='c008'>The organ from its rumbling broke out into its
full volume, a giant treading in wrath through the
forest, a storm rolling among the echoes of the hills.
Night came, and the clouds moved invisibly past
overhead, over the abbey and the floods. Nothing
but the dark flats of water lay between the abbey
and the sea; its bells gave their music to the wind,
and the great voice of its organ was more than a
man-made thing. The black shape of the abbey on
the edge of the desolate floods bulked like a natural
growth rooted in old centuries, harmonious and consonant
with nature. To the vision of Silas Dene,
on which no human limitations were imposed, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>whose mind was fed on sound and thought alone,
the abbey was not less vast than night itself, only a
night within the night, an abode of ordered sound
within the gale of sound. In his fancy he was not
clear as to whether it were roofed over, or lay open
to the sky; he could vary his decision according to
the vagary of the moment, alternately picturing the
rafters high above his head, or the scudding moonlit
heavens of ragged black and silver. He put his
hands upon the pillars with no thought of man’s
construction; they seemed monolithic. He caressed
them, moving between them, leaning against them,
and listening to the organ. He was in a large, dim,
mysterious place, that had a kindred with the floods
and with the storm. He knew that all around him
were shadows which, while making no difference to
the perpetual shadow he himself lived in, obscured
and hampered the free coming and going of other
men. Darkness was to him a confederate and
an affinity; he would smile when people spoke of
nightfall or of an impenetrable fog. He searched
now with his hand until it touched the shoulder of a
kneeling woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are there any lights in the church?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“Why, surely!” she said, startled, “candles upon
the altar.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was displeased; he moved behind a column
where he knew the shadows would be deeper. The
organ had ceased, and he heard prayers. He shook
with inward mockery, confident that the abbey,
which he had endowed with a personality and had
adopted into his own alliance, would reject the
prayers as contemptuously as he himself rejected
them. It would await the renewed majesty of the
organ.... To Silas the organ represented no hymn
of praise; it represented only the accompaniment of
storm; he was not even troubled, because he did not
notice them, by the infantile words which the congregation
fitted to its chords. It had never occurred
to him to think of the abbey as a holy temple until
he came by chance upon a thing to which his imagination
made a kindled and ravenous response.</p>

<p class='c008'>For once he had not made for himself the discovery
of this new theme in the course of his reading.
He owed it, a resented debt, to the conversation
of his mates in the shops. Silas, listening, had felt
his ever-ready contempt surging within him; it
angered him to learn from illiterate men of a subject
that he alone amongst them was fitted to understand.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>They skirted round it; but he grasped it avidly,
adopting it, as though a niche in his mind had been
always waiting for it. He took it with him to the
abbey, like a man carrying something secret and
deadly under his cloak. Black Mass....</p>

<p class='c008'>He scarcely knew what it meant. He took it
principally as a symbol of distortion and mockery.
It seemed to be one of the phrases and summings
up he had always been searching for, he who liked to
condense a large vague district of imaginings into
a final phrase.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he remembered Black Mass in the ordinary
way, he smiled in satisfaction, and stowed it away
as a secret; but when he thought of it in the abbey
he hunched himself as though he were in the throes
of some physical pleasure. In bringing that thought
with him into the abbey he was taunting a tremendous
God, a revengeful God; and he exalted fearfully
in the latent implication of his own daring. Surely
courage could go no further than the defiance of
God! His ready ecstasy swept him away. The
world he lived in was a reversed world, where darkness
held the place of light; in the world of his soul
a similar order should prevail. Taut-strung, he cast
around for some piece of blasphemy, some monstrous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>thing that he could do,—he did not know
what. He only knew that now he was brave, though
it might be with the courage of hysteria; presently
he would be again afraid. He dreaded the return of
his cowardice. He had not been a coward the day
he had killed Hannah; only afterwards; he must not
dwell upon the afterwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had no weapon with him in the church except
his voice, and a penknife in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>He must achieve something; something! anything!</p>

<p class='c008'>In the midst of his excitement he took it into his
head that a piece of the ruined masonry, detached
by the wind, might fall in upon him and crush him.
Still chattering under his breath to himself, his
hands nervously working, he moved closer to the
shelter of the pillar. Here he felt more secure,
but still the gusts of storm sent waves of physical
anxiety through him. He was torn between that
small anxiety and the illimitable defiance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The organ swelled out again, lifting him upon its
great rhythm as a wave lifts a swimmer.</p>

</div>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>It was on the same unpropitious evening that
Silas’s only son returned to his home from Canada.</p>

<p class='c008'>The train discharging him at Spalding, he fought
his way against wind and rain, along the lonely road
on the top of the dyke. He trudged with his hands
in his pockets and a bundle on his back, the peculiar
bleakness of the road returning familiarly to him
after his absence of seven years. It was dark, but
through occasional rifts the moon appeared, showing
him the floods; they were familiar too,—their
wide flat stretches lying on either side of the high
dyke, and swept by the East Anglian wind straight
from the North Sea,—he knew in his very bones the
shape and sensation of the Fens; this was homecoming.
There was a knowledge, a grasp of the size,
shape, and colour—almost of taste and smell—a consciousness
that marked off home from any other
place.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>When he reached the village, he felt in similar
manner the presence of the factory on the one hand,
and of the abbey on the other, with the village lying
between them. His boots rang on the stone of the
pavements. That was the school, and this the concert-room....
He reached the double cottage
of his father and his uncle; he thought he would
surprise his father and mother, so without knocking
he turned the door-handle and went in.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nan was still sitting by the table on which her
zither lay; her hands were clasped and drooped
listlessly. Her whole attitude betrayed her dejection.
Morgan stood by the range talking. They
were alone, and young Dene recoiled, thinking he
had broken in upon strangers, though the smile was
still broadly upon his face, with which he had prepared
to greet his parents’ surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve made a mistake,” he muttered, “this used to
be Silas Dene’s cottage ... my name’s Martin Dene.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was a bronzed young man, with thick black
hair, a Roman nose, and a fine curved mouth; a
proud face, like the face upon a coin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you tell me where my father lives now?”
he added. He looked at them frankly; he took them
for a young married couple.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“Why, Martin!” cried Nan, recognising him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it’s Nancy Holden,” he said almost at the
same moment. They greeted one another gladly.
“You’re married? living here?” he asked, with a
glance at Morgan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Married to your uncle Gregory....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No! He could be your father!” exclaimed
young Dene naïvely, and again he glanced at
Morgan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no,” said Nan, flushing, and she hurried on
with an explanation, “Your father lives here still,
but he went out a little time back; he said he was
going to the abbey. He’ll be in presently. Sit
down; I’ll get you a cup of tea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But where’s mother?” asked Martin Dene, and
in his impulsive, attractive manner he strode across
the room, flung open the door that led to the staircase,
and shouted “Mother!”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>II</h3>

<p class='c010'>“What’s that?” cried Silas, startling them all.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had not heard him come in. He stood on
the threshold, his hand outstretched, the likeness
between himself and his son strongly apparent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“What’s that?” he repeated; “who’s that, calling
‘Mother’ here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silas, it’s Martin come home,” said Nan, who
was trembling and who had gone, quite unwittingly,
closer to Morgan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Martin? it’s suited him to come back, after seven
years?” Silas uttered a derisive “Ho!” He added,
“It’s too late, my boy, to come here calling ‘Mother.’
That’s rich, that is—eh, Nan?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What d’you mean?” said Martin Dene, swinging
round.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your mother’s dead, that’s what I mean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dead?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, dead three months ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dead! Mother dead? why? how?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell him, Nan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here,” said Morgan, speaking for the first
time, “I’m sorry you’ve got to learn this news....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, smooth it over! water it down! I didn’t
know you were there, Linnet,” interrupted Silas.
“I’ll tell him myself. Your mother was killed in
an accident—picked up unrecognisable—run over
by a train—now you know. Got anything to say?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My God!” said young Dene, covering his face.
Nan went up to him and began to whisper to him; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>heard her half through with horribly staring gaze,
but then, disregarding her, he cried in a hoarse voice
to his father, “Accident be damned! you drove her
to it. I know your ways—they drove me away to
Canada, and Elsie to London—I’ve seen her there—and
they drove mother to <i>that</i>—come, own up!
it was suicide, wasn’t it?” He made a movement
towards his father, but Nan clung to his arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I swear it wasn’t,” replied Silas, full of a
grim amusement at his suggestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, how did it happen, then? What’s your
account of what happened? Did any one see?”</p>

<p class='c008'>As neither of the others answered, Morgan said,
“Nobody saw it happen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Martin leapt on to that. “So it was never
explained?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Morgan, “the coroner’s inquest gave
Accidental Death.” Martin laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re going now, I suppose?” said Silas,
“Morgan’s answered you, and his answer can hardly
satisfy you. Suspicion’s a sleepless guest in the
mind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re alone now, father?” asked the son. His
tone altered as a sort of pity and repentance overcame
him, and as he remembered his father’s blindness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Perhaps I spoke too hasty, father; see here,
I’ll stop on with you if you like.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t like; you can get out,” said Silas. Morgan
and Nan gave an exclamation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll stop to-night; we’re not calm, either of us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t remember you calm, somehow?” Silas
sneered. Martin’s temper, which he had controlled,
rose again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll get out, then,” he said, moving towards the
door. Nan, through her terror, thought him very
handsome,—bronze and black, his bony cheeks
still glistening from the rain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You needn’t bother to come back, after another
seven years.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you worry, father; I won’t come back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Martin!” cried Nan. This flare of quarrel
between father and son troubled her greatly; it was
a disturbance of harmony, and she longed for the
re-establishment of peace, at the same time dreading
further questionings, further possible accusations;
Martin would probe and examine, Silas might lose
his head,—Nan, knowing the truth, lived in the
perpetual terror of a frenzied outburst of candour
on Silas’s part.... He was, she knew, quite capable
of such an outburst. Life, and the harmony of life,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>would be less endangered with Martin out of the
way. But this was an unkind greeting for Martin
at his home—poor Martin! after seven years’ absence
and a trudge in the rain, to find his mother
dead and his father ferocious!—Nan’s fund of pity
overflowed, and she tried to compromise: “Martin!
you can’t walk back to Spalding through this awful
night; stop till to-morrow with Gregory, and me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not he!” said Silas, unexpectedly, and as though
he spoke with pride.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re right, father,—though I thank you, Nan;
you mean it kindly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They mean everything kindly, Martin,” said
Silas, indicating the other two. He continued to
speak with the same curious understanding towards
his son. Nan and Morgan, separately, stood repudiated
and estranged.</p>

<p class='c008'>Martin Dene nodded, his eyes meditatively upon
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Won’t you stop, Martin?” urged Nan’s timid
voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve said an unforgivable thing to father,” he
said, turning to her, in patient explanation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you didn’t think it, Martin; tell your father
you didn’t think it.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“I did think it; I still think it; father knows that.
I shall always think it. That’s why I can’t stop.
So long,” he said, shouldering his bundle; he nodded
to them again and went out.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>III</h3>

<p class='c010'>“Are you satisfied now, Silas, are you satisfied?”
Silas kept mumbling to himself later as with haste
he tore his clothes off in the dark.</p>

<p class='c008'>He would tell Lady Malleson—tell her that he had
wantonly thrown out his own son. What would she
think of that? Once she had said he was terrible;
he hoped that she would say it again. The words
had crowned him with a rare reward. Surely he had
earned their repetition?</p>

<p class='c008'>He scrambled into his bed; lay there with his
muscles jerking. He tautened them, trying to keep
them still, but could not. Martin, yes; he had thrown
out Martin. That was a resolute thing to do. It was
all of a piece with what had gone before; Hannah
had ministered to his comfort; in a rough and ready
way, it was true, often more rough than ready; but
still she had ministered; and Hannah, along with his
personal comfort and convenience, had been sacrificed
when necessity dictated. (If he chose to consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>in the light of a necessity the suspicion of an
outrage upon his own sensitive dignity which another
man might have dismissed as negligible, even
inevitable, that was his own business; nobody else’s.)
Hannah had gone. Now Hannah’s son, for a quick,
intuitive suspicion of his father, had gone too—thrown
out to founder, possibly, though the sequel
was now no concern of Silas’s; Martin was proud,
Martin would not return, least of all to appeal for
help. Lying awake in the night that to him was no
more deeply night than midday, Silas fought his regret
for Martin. Martin had come, his memory rich
with what garnered tales of peril? he had led a
hunter’s life among red men, bony, painted, feathered
men; he had tracked wounded beasts, either great-horned
or soft-footed; he had dared the great
solitudes, blazed his way through forests, and taken
his chance of the rapids; with all this, Martin, a fine
young man, would have beguiled his father’s ears
and opened new horizons to his insatiable fancy.
Bringing all this with him, like a pedlar’s pack,
Martin had tramped along the dyke from Spalding;
no doubt with a certain pitiful eagerness he made
his way home from the incredible distance of that
rough primitive world. Tears forced themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>out from Silas’s sightless eyes. He had never wept
for Hannah, he had hated Hannah, even when
through her death she became, poor woman, an
object of satisfaction to his insecure vanity; an
object, too, of allurement to his prowling cowardice.
But for Martin he wept, for Martin and all that
Martin stood for. Then envy shook him, that
Martin, free, young, keen-sighted, and, above all,
fearless,—fearlessness was the only true freedom,—should
be returning to that worthy life, in more
ways than one a hunter of big game. Big game!
to the simple, eager nature all life was big game.
The actual quarry; the stake in a hazardous enterprise;
the test of endurance; or the interlude of
women,—all that was big game; a big, audacious,
masculine game. The hint, the mere passing
suggestion, of enterprise acted as a sufficient stimulant,
under which his imagination flamed at once
as a torch, widening a bright, lit space in the
darkness, populating it with figures full of splendour,
heroically proportioned. He reached out to another
and more ardent life, away from the security in
which he so carefully preserved himself. He was
pierced through by the sheer valour of man, as a
shaft of light might on a sudden have pierced his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>darkness. He beheld man, small, imperfect, but
dauntless; sustained by a spirit of extraordinary
intrepidity, intent upon the double mastery of his
planet and of his own soul; man, stern against his
own weakness, checked here and thwarted there by
the inner treachery of his own heart, foiled in his
ambitions, cast down from such summits as he had
attained, but ever fighting forward in the pursuit
of an end perhaps undistinguishable, to which the
path of conquest, so difficult, so jeopardous, was
in itself a measure of recompense. So he was blind,
as blind as Silas himself; the more honourable
because, despite his blindness, he still wrought
undeterred.</p>

<p class='c008'>How various were his pursuits, his methods of
conquest! to maintain and advance himself in the
supreme captaincy; so diverse the images of vigour
which the labourer in his activity was too simple to
suspect. There were men who wrested from the
earth the last guarded secrets, pitting their limbs
against forest, mountain, ice, or waterless plain;
only their soft limbs against the giant sentries of
unhandseled nature; those who scored the monotonous
sea with the rich and coloured roads of
commerce, heaping in the harbours of the world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the strangeness of cargoes, always strange because
always exotic; those who tilled the responsive soil;
the hunters, the fighters, and the princes; others
who, living their true life, sequestered and apart by
reason of their austere calling, through a patience so
immense that the profound darkness of the mysteries
with which it dealt was punctuated by reward of
fresh light only here and there along the wide-spaced
generations, gained fragment by fragment the
knowledge of the ordering of distant worlds; the
women who bore the burden of fresh lives,—he
could feel himself alien to none of these, neither to
the law-givers nor the law-breakers; the acquiescent
nor the rebellious; no, nor the spare anchorite who
aspired through lonely frugality and penance
towards the same summit of domination; he
stretched out his hand, alike to king and prostitute,
and with the falling strove still to uplift the tattered
standard, and with the multitude of the triumphant
marched upon the road of pride. All this he saw
with a clarity, a wholeness that was in the nature of
actual beholding far more than of the blurred confusion
of a vision. He had his landscape under sharp
sunlight, precision of detail allying itself with
breadth of horizon. He saw, too, skulking in and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>out amongst the pageantry rich with legend that
went its way under windy banners, he saw dark,
puny, ignoble figures; not one of them bore the tool
of an honest craft, but small forked tongues darted
between their lips; and in his abasement he included
himself in their number, and questioned whether the
rest of them, damned spirits, worshipped in secret,
as he did, the magnificence they must envenom
because they could not share?</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>IV</h3>

<p class='c010'>Then with a rush of incredulous disgust the
constituents of his own existence stood out in the
same white light; confused, craven, petty; a tangle
that he despised and loathed with a weak fury, the
more that he could not extricate himself. Envy
without emulation, spite without hatred, violence
without strength! Then the personages: Hambley,
the lick-spittle go-between; Christine Malleson,
whose pretended mental companionship with him
disguised the claw of cruelty; inanimate objects,
the floods, the gale; Hannah, a ghost now, not
a personage, a ghost that gave him no rest, try as
he would to weld the whole incident to his own uses,
to the furtherance of his own self-confidence;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Martin, sacrificed for the same purpose; Nan, the
object of an as yet ill-defined, floating malevolence
that crouched ready for a spring on to the back of
the first poor pretext; all the men, his fellows, in
whom he amused himself by fostering dissatisfaction;
and, lastly, he found that he must include an
animal in this lamentable population,—the donkey
on the green, that, no less than the others, had, that
evening, fallen a victim to his need for mischief;
the coarse pelt was still vivid under his fingers, as
he had slid his hand down the leg, till he came to
the fetlock, and he remembered now the sharp
puncture of the knife into the sinew, and the animal’s
start of pain—to this, to this had he sunk! when he
crept out from the abbey, his soul seething with
blasphemy, and his fingers closing over the penknife
in his pocket! A small, mad deed,—all that his soul
in travail could bring forth. In this deed, tinily
terrible, had his exaltation culminated; the exaltation
engendered by storm, by the disaster on the dyke,
by the organ swelling in the ruined abbey, by the
suggestion of the Black Mass.</p>

<p class='c008'>He rolled from side to side in his bed, tearing at
the blankets with his teeth.</p>

<p class='c008'>He directed his despair and fury then against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Christine Malleson, making her responsible for this
ruthless savagery which always possessed him,
without system or goal beyond a need to damage
everything that was happy, prosperous, and entire.
True, she was partly responsible; she was responsible
for the pranks of experiment that she played upon
him, stirring and poking his mind, his ambitions,
into a blaze, and the chill “Don’t forget yourself,”
with which she quenched the flame. He raged
against Christine: she had him at a disadvantage; he
must strive always to compete with her serenity of
class; she drew him out from his own class, aroused
his angry socialism, laughed at the gaps in his knowledge,
gave him glimpses of a life whose significance
and habit he could never encompass, but which he
burnt with an envious hatred to destroy; then she
would laugh at him again,—she, who had come down
from her heights to walk curiously in his valleys,—she
would laugh, and he would fling away into fresh
magniloquence, seeking to impress her; and when
the time came for him to take his leave, the excitable
irritation provoked by her remained still unappeased,
consuming his vitals. But this he believed she did
not suspect. So far as he knew, he had deceived
her; he had passed off upon her the old fraud of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>making her believe him strong when he was, in
reality, the bewildered, unhappy prey of his own
weakness. The thought that he had so deceived her
gave him a little satisfaction. He would tell her
about Martin; she would catch her breath. He
would not tell her about the donkey. And he
swayed again from the paltry tangle of his own life
to the bright heroic visions that alone contented him,
weeping with an incurable sorrow, but whether for
Martin or the vague grandeur of the unattainable,
he could not well have said.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>If the floods would but retreat! If the winter
would but dissolve and allow spring to break over
the land! Then the rich black loam of the fields
would appear in the place of the water,—that flat
and cruel, unprofitable water,—and the country
under the blush of green would cease to be so mournful,
rayless, and forbidding. The floods were so
dead; dead brown, dead level; there was no life in
them, except sometimes under the red sun, a fierce,
angry sort of life, and sometimes when the wind
beat them; but now gray rainy day succeeded gray
rainy day, mild indeed, but not spring, not the spring
of clear sunlit showers and rainbows! It would be
a dark, fertile country that came to light, curiously
un-English in its effect of unboundaried acreage,
wide ditches marking off the fields in the place of
hedges. Ditches and dykes would remain as the scar
and testimony of the floods, the dykes that like some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Roman aqueduct stretched away into the flat and
misty distances.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yearly Nan lived through the winter in the hope
of such a spring, and almost yearly it failed her.
She was drawn towards spring with an instinct of
unsatisfied youth. It appeared to her like a vista
cut in the darkness of the life she led between Silas
and Gregory.</p>

<p class='c008'>The population of her world was so restricted;
in very early days she had been sharply taught that
Gregory would neither welcome his wife’s friends
at his fireside, nor allow her to go to theirs. She
had never forgotten the written message he had left
for her on the table in the first week of their marriage,
having found her laughing in the kitchen
with another girl: “No <i>prying eyes</i> here, missis.”
The Denes, she learnt, were as sensitive as they were
savage and solitary, and, so strong was the legend
that they had created around themselves, that she
had found herself quickly alienated from the rest
of the village and definitely regarded as of the company
inhabiting the lonely cottage. Silas, Gregory,
Linnet Morgan, Donnithorne sometimes, Mr. Calthorpe.
That was all. The two dominating figures
were Silas and Gregory; she was more frightened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>of Silas than of Gregory, because of her secret
knowledge, but Gregory was like a stranger to her;
she was submissive to him but felt no nearness, no
intimacy; he was more closely allied to Silas than
to her. Of Linnet Morgan she thought with shy
and oddly pleasurable evasion. Of Calthorpe, with
confidence; she liked his well-brushed hair, precisely
parted down one side, and the close pointed beard
that gave him a certain robust dignity and rather
the appearance of a sailor; thinking of Calthorpe
was like leaning up against a solid and stable building.
He looked at her with great kindliness now,
when she talked to him; she had always wanted
somebody to look at her like that. It awoke, too,
in her a certain pride: she had trained this big man
in the part she wanted him to play; she, so small,
had taught him, so large, a trick, and whenever she
brought him her confidences, and he responded with
that look so full of kindliness, he was doing the
trick she had trained him, against his will, to do.
This gave her a proprietary sense in him. She found
him very docile. He, on his part, loved her for her
little domineering manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was only when she returned to Silas and
Gregory that she was made to realise her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>futility. Against the weak pushing of her hands
they remained immovable....</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she fell sometimes into despair, and her
courage crumpled. For days she would be silent,
then with an effort she would bring out her zither
and sing, until before their contempt her voice
would trail away again miserably into silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>She longed for the retreat of the floods and the
end of the winter, because now the country and
the year seemed to be conspiring with Silas and
Gregory.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>II</h3>

<p class='c010'>Once she tried to bring about a complete revolution
in all their lives; only once. She was really
half-crazy with despair when she made the attempt;
nothing else could have given her the courage. As
it was, she was intimidated by her own audacity,
for by nature she accepted circumstances without
questioning. Inaugurations terrified her; yet here
was she, Nan, inaugurating.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sat at the table, under the lamp, Silas and
Gregory on either side of her, the remains of supper
before them. She sat twisting her hands; swallowing
hard.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>She began, “Shall we be here always?” then
stopped, then plunged on again, “living always here,
with the floods every winter, all the winter through?
Why shouldn’t we go away, somewhere else, if we
choose? Why shouldn’t we?” she cried suddenly,
in a frightened voice, as nobody answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at Silas and Gregory; Silas was smiling,
and Gregory was smiling too, in a twisty,
derisive way, as though he knew what she had been
talking about. Yet he couldn’t know. Silas had
a look of surprise and amusement; grateful surprise,
as though she had provided him with an unexpected
amusement in an hour of boredom.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go on!” he said to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>At that she felt all her source of boldness, of
inventiveness, dried up within her. What was the
good of this struggle for escape when she was
hemmed in, not only by the floods and the dykes,
but by those two immovable men who owned her?
But her terror urged against her hopelessness; and
was the stronger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you <i>like</i> living here?” she appealed to Silas,
trying to touch him upon his own inclinations.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As well here as anywhere else,” he answered. “I
work here.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>She knew the bitterness that edged his voice
whenever he mentioned his work.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You tie up parcels in a packing-shed,” she said,
“always the same,—work that a half-wit could do.
Yes, a poor wanting creature could do your work.
Why don’t you bestir yourself? Why don’t you
come away?” She talked so, knowing that she
strained to pull a weight that lay solid against her
small strength.</p>

<p class='c008'>If only Silas or Gregory would get up, she thought
that with that insignificant display of mobility her
hope would revive; but they sat on either side of her,
cast in bronze. If they were doomed men, then they
made no effort to escape their doom. Too proud,
perhaps. They sat and waited. They seemed too
indifferent to care.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nobody’s put you in prison into Abbot’s
Etchery,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet they were so like prisoners, Silas in his darkness,
Gregory in his silence, that she almost looked
for gyves about their wrists and ankles. When
they stirred, it should have been to the accompaniment
of a heavy clank. When Silas fought, when
he cried aloud, it was the struggle of a chained man.
But his struggles were so ineffective; Nan, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>not oppressed from within, but only from without,
thought that he could help himself if he would.
She had all the impatience of the naturally buoyant
with the dogged tragedy of the fatalistic.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come away,” she urged. “What is it that keeps
you here? There are warm, pretty places. Let’s
make the best of things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I might get away from Abbot’s Etchery, I
shouldn’t be getting away from myself,” said
Silas.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nan cried out, “<i>Can’t</i> one get away? Who says
so? Isn’t it in our own hands?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it?” replied Silas, letting drop the sorrowful
query as though it were rather the echo of a perpetual
self-communion revolving in his soul, than
an idle response.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old mournfulness, the old anguish, closed
down upon them again. They were like haunted
people, who would not help themselves. They seemed
haunted by the past,—which contained indeed the
death of Hannah, a death so rough and dingy,—by
the present, and by the overcharged future. But
their dread was not to be defined; it was of the
nature of a mystic sentence, presaged from a long
way off. Sometimes she thought that they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>afraid of themselves; sometimes that they were too
apathetic to be afraid. Only Silas made his dungeon
clamorous sometimes with his wild revolt, that led
to nothing, to no change, to no illumination.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>III</h3>

<p class='c010'>Calthorpe found her sitting listless in a corner.
She showed a hunted preference for corners, and for
shelter behind furniture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, you’re pale,” he said. He came closer,
“You’re wan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She did a rare thing: she put her hand into his
and let him hold it, which he did as though it were
a child’s. He was overcome by her smallness and
frailty; she seemed to be almost transparent, and
her features were tiny and delicate, but her eyes
were large as she raised them. “Not ill?” he asked.
“No,” she replied, “only tired and afraid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Afraid of what?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, not afraid really; only worn.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, indeed; you’re like a little wraith. You’d
blow away in a puff.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He could not rouse her at all; she made no complaint,
but sat very quiet and beaten, letting her
hand lie in his. In reply to his questions, she kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>on saying that she was tired. He knew that she
meant spiritually, not physically, tired. She was
very polite to him, saying “No, thank you, Mr.
Calthorpe,” and he found her extremely pitiable,
but his science failed him when he tried to think
of a remedy. He could only sit alternately patting
and pressing her hand. She gave him a grateful
smile, at length.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You do me good, just by being there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, that’s better; won’t you tell me now what
was the matter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I only want to be happy,” she said suddenly,
and her mouth quivered beyond her control, so she
bit her under-lip and looked away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, my dear! my dear!” said poor Calthorpe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to run by the sea, over the sands,” she
cried, as though her heart had burst its compressing
bonds; “I used to live by the sea once, in the south,
and I think about it ... and the birds nesting.
There were gulls upon all the rocks. There were
white splashes down the rocks. It wasn’t home.
But I’m homesick, I think.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re just a child,” said Calthorpe. “You want
to play. Poor little soul!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, how kind you are,” she said, and he felt her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>fingers flutter within his hand. “I get so tired of
fighting, sometimes....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Won’t you tell me just exactly what you’re
fighting against?” He was very patient and full of
pity, but believing her to be slightly hysterical he
had the reasonable man’s reliance on a calm statement
of her difficulties to disperse much of their
bogie-mist.</p>

<p class='c008'>She only said, however, “I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>(“Hysteria,” he thought. If she had said,
“Forces of darkness,” he would have started mistrustfully,
without allowing himself to be impressed.
But she was too ignorant to use the phrase.)</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, then,” he said heartily, “it can’t be a very
serious enemy if you can’t give it a name,—what?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s everything,” she said, “the floods,—I hate
them,—the factory.... If the factory would stop,
sometimes, but it never does: always that black
smoke, and the men working in shifts to keep it
going, and then the men always talking about wages,
and sometimes the strikes. Even the abbey gets
to be like the factory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re fanciful,” said Calthorpe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anybody would get fanciful, living with Silas
and Gregory,” she replied mournfully.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>How she changed! he reflected. Sometimes she
ordered him about, and sometimes she came to him
like a child for consolation. Whatever her mood,
he never ventured upon familiarity. He told himself
sometimes with irritation that he had never
been kept so at arm’s length by an otherwise friendly
woman. He was a wholesome and masculine man,
and he had a wholesome and masculine liking for
the company of woman in his hours of relaxation,
and in regard to Nan had certainly intended their
friendship to run upon different lines, harmless
enough, but perhaps a little more stimulating; he
found, however, that quite quietly it was she who
decided the direction, while he in aggrieved but unprotesting
surprise fell meekly in with her wishes.
He often told himself that he was wasting his time,
and would go no more to the Denes’ cottage, but he
always broke his resolution.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is Morgan no help to you? he’s something young
about the house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t speak to him much, he’s always in his
books. I wish you lived in the house, Mr. Calthorpe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I did, Nan.” But on the whole, he
thought, he was glad he didn’t.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>
  <div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>IV</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Morgan, whom Nan represented as being always
in his books, was by inclination a scientist, but for
the moment, until he had the means to devote himself
to his profession, he managed that branch of
the factory concerned with scents and powders.</p>

<p class='c008'>He worked among shining alembics and great-bellied
bottles of dark green glass, standing round
his room in rows.</p>

<p class='c008'>The latticed window was hung with cobwebs.
The table was littered with bottles, saucepans, test-tubes,
and little flames burning. Of all things in
the room, the alembics alone were kept clean, gleaming
bright brass globes, pair by pair, connected by
twisting pipes, and ever dripping the distilled, overpowering
scent into dishes put ready to receive it.
They shone out from the disorder of the room.
Canisters ranged round the walls on shelves: benzoin,
civet, frankincense, ambergris,—the names on
the labels smouldered as a group of Asiatics among
ordinary people.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nan was sent up with a message to him in this
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>She appeared in the doorway, continuing to knock
as she pushed open the door, in the bright blue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>overall she wore when at her work. She was smiling
shyly, as though she expected a welcome. But
he did not immediately see her. He was bending
with great absorption over a little pair of scales,
weighing a quantity of grains, and when he had
done this he poured the grains very carefully into a
kind of box, which he set above a small lamp to
heat. Then as he wiped his hands on a piece of
linen, he caught sight of her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Dene! What brings you here? what bit of
luck? What extraordinary bit of luck?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He went to her, drew her into the room, and shut
the door. He gazed at her with incredulous delight.
He wanted to touch her, to make sure that she was
real.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why don’t you tell me?” he queried, as she stood
there smiling but not speaking.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she delivered her message, every word seemed
to give birth to an unspoken, irrelevant flight of
words that fluttered round them with ghostly rustle
of wings, finding no resting-place. When she had
finished, she stood irresolute.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must go back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her eyes roamed over the room, and every now
and then swept over him in passing. They caressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>him in that quick, diffident, gentle way she had.
They rested with a mild dismay on all his disorder,
and a pucker of trouble appeared between her brows.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter, Mrs. Dene?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, your things want straightening,” she murmured
in tones of distress. “Doesn’t any one have
charge of your room? The dust,—look at it! The
litter!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She moved to his table as though her deft hands
were yearning towards it. She made little tentative
touches at his things, while he watched her. She
looked at him to see whether she was annoying
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, do you mind?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“On the contrary, I like to see you doing it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She gained courage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You haven’t a duster, have you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He discovered a duster in the table drawer and
gave it to her; like all good workmen, she was
heartened by the touch of an instrument, however
humble, of her natural work. She picked things up
and set them down more briskly, saying meanwhile,
half in excuse for her briskness,—</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must hurry, or they’ll be missing me downstairs.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“You can say I kept you. I’ll find something
for you to take to the forewoman; that’ll be an
excuse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An excuse—is that right, do you think? But
your room <i>is</i> in a mess, isn’t it? It can’t have been
touched for months. Does no one clean up?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I won’t let them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You ought to have told me,” she said, greatly
distressed. “I am so sorry ... I didn’t think.
Some men are like that, I know. They think they
can find things better. But I haven’t tidied; look,
nothing has been moved.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I told you I liked to see you doing it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You were civil,” she said, not comforted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I’m never civil.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh yes, Mr. Morgan; you can’t help it, if you’re
civil in your heart. It comes kindly, to folk who
laugh as much as you do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You laugh too; I’ve heard you laughing downstairs,
in the workroom. You and I laugh more
than Silas and Gregory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gregory can’t laugh,” she said gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a moment their chatter stopped quite short.
Then she began again,—</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must go now, Mr. Morgan.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“No, stay; you shall look at some of my things,”
he cried, making a movement to detain her. “These
are the alembics where the scent is distilled,” he
went on; “of course, these are only the small ones
that I use for my own experiments; I expect you’ve
seen the big ones in the shed downstairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The shed all littered with sandal-wood shavings?
I like it; it smells good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It smells good here in my room too, don’t you
think? That’s because of the scent dripping from
the alembics. You see it drips into these pannikins
that are put there to catch it. They are all new
scents—new combinations of scents, that is—that
I’m trying.” He was eager, both for the sake of his
work and in his anxiety to hold her interest. “Now
I’ll show you some of the raw material; it doesn’t always
smell good before we’ve been to work upon it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He wondered whether he might take her arm,
whether he might venture. She was like the little
bird to which he always compared her, and as
easily scared! He turned the question over and
over in his mind while he was talking, now bracing
himself to be bold, now shrinking back; almost
moving towards her; but while hesitation still
swirled within his mind he found that his hand had,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>quite simply, taken hers. “It’s so natural, so fitting,
for me to take her hand, that she hasn’t even
noticed,” he thought with joy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“These are the canisters where I keep my raw
stuff,” he said, pointing to the tin canisters ranged
on shelves. They stood hand in hand reading the
names on the labels.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ambergris—that’s the name of a scent I bottle,”
she said, with a little laugh. “I use a lavender ribbon
for that. And orris—that’s the powder. Don’t
they have queer names? Opoponax, that always
makes me laugh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They laughed together over opoponax.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And there’s names out of Scripture,” she said,
“frankincense and myrrh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He took down the tin of benzoin, and made her
smell it, shaking some of the brittle stuff into the
palm of her hand; crumbling up her hand into a
cup, and guiding it now to her nose and now to his
own. They compared their tastes; “I think this
sort smells nicest,” she said to him, gravely holding
out her cupped hand, but he would not agree, after
bending over it with the deliberation of a practised
critic, and added a little storax, which, he said,
brought out the pungency of the benzoin.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>“All these gums and resins,” he said, “come from
trees; you cut a gash in the tree, and the gum comes
from it like blood from a wound, oozing out. And
one of them—labdanum—is got by the natives by
beating the bush with long whips; or sometimes
they get it by combing the beards of the goats which
have been browsing off the bush.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That made her laugh too, but she was impressed by
his knowledge, and that made him laugh in his turn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now I’ll show you the woods,—you said you
liked the sandal-wood; well; this is cedar, don’t you
like that even better? Shall I give you some to
take away in a little packet? you can keep it with
your clothes, like the sachets you tie up downstairs.”
He thought with a momentary panic that he might
have offended her by referring to her clothes, but the
hint of intimacy in the suggestion pleased and
troubled him so much that he was glad he had taken
the risk for the sake of that pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was not offended; she only blushed a little.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That will be nice,—but I’m taking all your time,
Mr. Morgan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no; I have plenty of time, and there’s lots
more that I could show you. I could tell you a good
deal, too, that might amuse you: how the Egyptians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>used to embalm their mummies, and how an Assyrian
king caused himself to be burnt with all his
wives on a high pyre of scented boughs sooner than
fall into the hands of an enemy. And how the
Chinese hunt for musk; this is musk; it doesn’t smell
nice in this state, but it’s very precious. This is attar
of roses in this little bottle; smell very carefully. Let
me hold it for you. Do you like my things?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She liked his things very much.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think my room less untidy and dusty,
now that you know there are other things in it besides
dust and untidiness?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All those tins, full of sweet scents,” she said
unexpectedly. “Only, I ought to go back to my
work now, don’t you think? You said you would
give me something to take to the forewoman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you said that wasn’t right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, perhaps it isn’t,—Oh, I see: you’re teasing
me. Well, I’ll go without it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you’re frightened of being scolded?” he said,
following her and laying his hand upon the handle
of the door. “Now aren’t you? confess! What
do you say when the forewoman is cross? Do you
stand hanging your head and twisting your apron?”
He was laughing down at her.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“She isn’t often cross, but she will be if I stay
dawdling here,—oh, <i>please</i>, Mr. Morgan!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He saw with astonishment that her eyes were suddenly
brimming with tears, and her soft mouth
quivered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are dreadfully unkind, getting me into
trouble and then teasing me about it,” she said,
nearly crying, but trying to conceal it from him.
“I enjoyed looking at the scents, and I forgot the
time, but now it is all different, and I want to go
away, please. Please take your hand off the door-handle,”
she continued, trying to pull away his
fingers with her weak ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, you have got quite excited,” he said gently;
“look, I am not keeping you—I have let go of the
handle—but won’t you wait while I write a note
to the forewoman? I want to send her a message,
I really do! Won’t you wait for it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, if you ask me as one of the girls, I
must.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re terribly perverse!” he exclaimed, half annoyed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you ask me as one of the girls....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well; Nan, will you please wait a minute
while I write a note for you to take to Miss Dawson?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>He was not sure to what extent she was
serious or joking. Then she flushed at his use of
her name, but he saw that she was not joking at all.
“What a strange, perplexing thing!” he commented
inwardly, as he searched for a pencil among the
litter on his table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you’re looking for your pencil, I put it in the
tray with your measure and the little thermometer,”
she volunteered sulkily.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was on the tip of his tongue to say, “You said
you hadn’t tidied!” but a glance at her face, which
was still quivering with her aroused sensitiveness,
warned him not to tease her. He sat down and
wrote his note while she waited over by the door,
then he brought it across to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have we quarrelled?” he said wistfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there no message with the note?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How severe you are!” He held the note just
out of her reach, risking her anger if he might keep
her a moment longer. “Have you got the packet of
cedar-dust I gave you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She made one of the patch-pockets on her overall
gape, and let him see the packet within. He gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>her the note reluctantly, and opened the door for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-bye, Mr. Necromancer, with your alembics,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop! where did you get that big word?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Out of a book.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He could think of nothing to say but “What
book?” in order to delay her, but she was already
half-way down the passage. He watched her till
she was out of sight, then returned to his room and
shut the door. “She’s like a little delicate moth flitting
through gross life,” he thought, and he wandered
about his room, touching the things which
had taken her fancy most.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>He was on duty at the factory that night, so Silas,
not to be alone, had his supper with Nan and Gregory.
The households of the double-cottage were
so interchangeable that it increased Nan’s sense of
restriction within that grim and tiny circle, the
monotony of knowing that after supper Gregory
would bring out his roll of drawings and flatten them
out on the table with drawing-pins, and that Silas
would surround himself with his great Braille
volumes, running his fingers over the pages while
his eyes would remain fixed on some distant corner
and expressions of amusement, interest, or indignation
uncannily succeeded each other upon his face.
To watch him while he was reading never ceased
to fascinate and frighten Nan. To see him laughing
when no one could tell what he was laughing
at, when his eyes were not even bent upon the
page!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>But to-night she had other thoughts. They were
not thoughts, they were a timorous, shying riot,
that took hands; danced; and upon detection broke
up into a scattered rabble. She knew only that they
were lovely, and felt the soft muslin of their garments
as they passed her. Not thoughts! no, they
were more like wings, song, and breeze all chasing
one another in her heart. Even the bronze presence
of Silas and Gregory could not weigh against their
feathery loveliness. She was bewildered, turning
this way and that with hands outstretched, trying
to capture one, to hold it, and examine it; but she
could not, either because it eluded her, or because
she feared to rub away its bloom and colour. She
was like a girl, blindfolded, playing blindman’s buff
in the midst of a ring of children. She sat quite idle,
not consciously thinking, not even conscious that she
was happy. For the moment she was completely
happy; she had forgotten both Silas and Gregory.
Calthorpe would not have found her wan; her cheeks
were flushed and her lips parted, but so abstracted
was she that she did not know it. She did not know
that she was idle, although she was usually busy
over some little industry. She had lost all sense
save that of well-being and deliverance.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Silas recalled her as he shut his volume with a
bang.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you doing, Nan?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh....” She rebelled against this inquisition,
irritated for once because she was startled. For all
that she lived between a blind man and a deaf one,
she had perpetually the sensation of being both
watched and overheard. Her instinct leaped to a
pang of guilt in being detected idle, and she resented
the unspoken criticism. “Nothing, Silas; thinking.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What about?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wondered what you were reading,” she lied.</p>

<p class='c008'>He reopened the book, always eager to share out
his own impressions. Trying page after page with
his fingers, he came at last to the passage he sought.
She saw the raised letters standing up in their
strange shapes, casting strange little shadows.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll read to you, shall I?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He began to read,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how
much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of
thy ointments than all spices!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb:
honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell
of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring
shut up, a fountain sealed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with
pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with
all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the
chief spices.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters and
streams from Lebanon.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow
upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.
Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his
pleasant fruits.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nan was not able to speak; she had listened with
indrawn breath, and her hand had flown upwards
to her heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t like that—sugar!” said Silas resentfully.
“You liked it, I expect? This suits me better,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will even appoint over you terror, consumption,
and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes and
cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in
vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I will set my face against you, and ye shall
be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall
reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth
you.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I will break the pride of your power; and I
will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:</p>

<p class='c012'>“And your strength shall be spent in vain; for your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees
of the land yield their fruits.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall
rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and
make you few in number; and your highways shall
be desolate....</p>

<p class='c012'>“And upon them that are left alive of you, I will
send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their
enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase
them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and
they shall fall when none pursueth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nan had not listened; the music of that other
verse was running in her drunken head, “Spikenard
and saffron; calamus and cinnamon; myrrh and
aloes, with all the chief spices....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Half of the Bible should be printed in blood,”
said Silas, meditating the fulminations, “and read
with a spear in the hand.—But it’s a trick, a trick!”
he said, instantly checking his enthusiasm, with the
mocking twist on his mouth, “I do the trick myself,
sometimes, to demolish it,” and turning over the
pages of Leviticus, he came across a sheet covered
with his own handwriting, which he gave to Nan.
“Read it aloud.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She read,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Consider how miserable a pigmy is man, who for
his most terrible fancy conceives bulk, weight, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>uproar; the magnifying of what he commonly beholds.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Get hence, thou starveling, thou poverty-stricken
of spirit! let thy poor eyes dictate; creation was not
given unto thee.</p>

<p class='c012'>“God said: I will be niggardly toward my servant;
the earth will I give him, and the sea and the sky shall
be his; but in his heart shall he find no separate image.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look, then, within thy heart: what shalt thou find?
a perishable hate, a faltering resolve, and, for thy
richest treasure, the swift feet of love.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Terror shalt thou find, and care; the terror of the
seen and the unseen; of the steps that pursue thee, and
the voices that cry out thy name.</p>

<p class='c012'>“These shall be thy companions; that shall clog thy
spirit throughout all thy days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well? hey? shorn of its magic?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Silas, to laugh at the Bible and write such
bitter things!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas roared with laughter; he clapped his hand
upon his knee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You little fool. Shall I redeem myself? Give
me a pencil and paper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She gave it to him in a dream. “A garden enclosed
is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a
fountain sealed....”</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas was writing; he wrote and chuckled, and
handed the sheet to Nan.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“Then man turned and said: ‘All these things are
true.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“But look again within my heart; thou shalt find
charity there, and pity like a healing ointment; reverence
before strength, and courage as an archangel in
bright armour.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Blow but upon the embers of truth which thou
shalt find, and they shall leap as a flame; truly, thou
shalt re-kindle the spark of thy breath in man.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So shalt thou not say in anger, ‘This man which
I have made is nothing worth.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does that please you better?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s surely not right, Silas.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right! a fig for right and its insipidity!”</p>

<p class='c008'>(“Insipid!” her heart rebelled; what could be insipid
when light was over the whole of life? new
light, young light?)</p>

<p class='c008'>“That first bit you read ...” she began, “it reminded
me of the scents at the factory; it was
funny your reading just that bit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas said nothing; he was biting his nails and
muttering; she resumed, drawn onward though reluctant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It put me in mind of Mr. Morgan’s room; he
has things like that—spikenard and saffron, and the
rest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Morgan’s room—how do you know?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>She was terrified by his pounce upon her out of
the heart of his abstraction.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I was sent there with a message.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To-day?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, this afternoon.” Although she was guiltless
she had all the quick panic of guilt,—what
should she say? what must she not say? hold concealed?—and
she felt that Silas held her pinned
down beneath talons while he pried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What message?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Dawson wanted something.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did she want?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To know whether he had ordered some printed
labels.” Again that panic of guilt, reassured now
because she could answer his question without
stumbling. She almost wanted to call his attention
to it, to say, “Look, I’m telling the truth; there’s
no necessity for me to invent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you went up to his room?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you saw the spices?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes—I was just saying, wasn’t I? that it was
funny you should choose that bit to read aloud.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I expect he showed them to you—he’s always
talking about them to me—did he?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“One or two—yes, he did show me. But I
couldn’t stop. I had my work waiting.” She regretted
ardently that she had introduced the subject;
she not only feared and mistrusted Silas’s inquisition,
but she also shrank, as with physical pain, at
his handling of it. He was rough and defamatory.</p>

<p class='c008'>His tone changed, and unexpectedly he continued
in a gentle, interested, and sympathetic voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad to think you make friends with Linnet.
I often think it’s hard for you, living between me
and Gregory; you’re a young thing, so’s Linnet;
it’s natural you should be drawn together. He’s got
a brain, too; none of your young fools! I’ve a grand
opinion of him. I thought when he first came to the
house that you and he would get laughing together.
Tell me what he looks like?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What he looks like, Silas?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, describe him to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He has short curly hair and always laughing
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anything else?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he looks younger than his age.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How old would you think him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, about twenty-two, twenty-three.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How old are you, Nan?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“Twenty-one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And he’s twenty-five. It sounds good. I’m
fifty. What more about Linnet?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t looked at him so closely, Silas.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean you haven’t noticed anything more?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, nothing more.” She had no shame, but
rather pride, in the lie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I had eyes, I should make better use of them,”
said Silas, not disagreeably. He went on, “I’ve
helped you and Linnet, haven’t I? sent you for walks
together, left you alone in my kitchen more than
once? I’m less soured than you think me. I’m
sorry for you sometimes, being young, and I liked
helping you to Linnet as a playfellow. You reckon
on me, little Nan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She did not know what to make of this. She
wanted to believe that Silas meant to be kind; indeed,
in spite of her latent scepticism she was
touched; but she was alarmed by and resisted the
insinuations of his words, which he had spoken in a
lower voice, as though in an unnecessary precaution
of secrecy before Gregory; she glanced at Gregory,
poising his beautifully sharpened pencil over his
drawing, and his fine looks, and coarse rough hair,
appeared to her distasteful. She looked at Silas, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>similar in build and feature, yet with a certain slyness
that was wholly absent from his brother. Silas
was speaking again,—</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you need anything, come to me, little Nan.
You’re good to me, and it’s not forgotten. We’ll
be allies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was the kind of phrase that frightened her,
and whirled her away before she was well aware, to
a region of tacit admissions and implications. Had
she said more than she meant? more than she even
thought? Why, she thought nothing, or had thought
nothing until Silas began, but now her sense of
undefined well-being was taking shape, emerging
from the mist of rustle and cadence, as the coast-line
of undiscovered country emerges from the sea mists
of dawn. She had been rushed; Silas had rushed
her. She thought with terror of how Silas had fastened
upon her first words; one could believe that he
had only been waiting for her to pronounce them.
He had been so ready. He had fired so many questions.
He had obliged her to say, or at least to
admit, by her silence, anything he wanted. He
might not want much yet, but later? later?</p>

<p class='c008'>Apparently he was satisfied for the moment, for
he picked up his Braille volume and fell to running
his finger tips over the pages, smiling to himself.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>She hoped that the subject would be forgotten.
It was not forgotten. That was clear to her, although
Silas made no direct allusion; but by his
manner he established the existence of a secret between
them, and because she dared not say to him,
“There is no secret,” the secret remained, growing
insidiously. She was nervous and uneasy in his
presence. Silas was kinder than ever she had known
him, kinder and gentler, also he appeared to be more
contented, but she had a terrified suspicion that he
was contented only because his mind was occupied,
and it seemed horrible to her that she should be the
centre of that occupation. She had suddenly become
involved in an affair whose existence, she protested
to herself, had its being solely as the outcome of
Silas’s imagination. She tried to shake it off and
to laugh it away, but he held her to it. She had the
helpless sensation of being on the end of a rope that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>he was slowly hauling in, maintaining his purchase
over every miserly inch as he gained it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hambley, soft-footed, insinuating, and urbane,
added by his parasitic presence to the uneasiness of
the house. The yellow faced, thin little man, with
his black hair and his long front teeth like a rodent’s,
never had an opinion of his own, but echoed Silas,
or cackled with the laughter of approval. He alternately
tried to provoke and to propitiate Nan and
Morgan, gibed at them when they were civil to him,
and fawned on them when they were curt. Nan
shuddered when she wondered how many of Silas’s
darker thoughts were shared out to his keeping.</p>

<p class='c008'>Was there a conspiracy against her? To her mind,
full of alarm, this seemed not impossible. Calthorpe
even,—her prop, her kind, comfortable friend,—Calthorpe
mentioned casually, “I may have to steal
Gregory from you, my dear; I must have a man with
me when I go to Birmingham to look over some new
plants, and I fancy that your Gregory would relish
the job, and be very useful to me.” She had clasped
his arm. “Oh no, don’t take Gregory away, Mr.
Calthorpe.” “What!” he said in surprise, “are you
so fond of him?” She did not answer. She was not
fond of Gregory; he was an owner and an institution,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>but the question of fondness played no part.
Hitherto, she had not thought of disliking him; that
was all. He and Silas (until she knew Silas was a
murderer) had appeared very much the same in her
mind, the only difference being that whereas Gregory
had rights over her passive and uninquiring person
Silas had none.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, am I not to take him?” asked Calthorpe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, take him,” she replied. Why had she hesitated?
By all these doubts and hesitations she was
playing Silas’s game; he had gained another inch
of the rope. “When are you going?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s all quite uncertain; I may not be going at all.
But if I go, it will be some time next month, and I
shall ask for Gregory. I am discovering that he has
the real knack for any kind of engine; he’s sulky
about it and contemptuous, but I urge him, and he
unfolds. He showed me some of his plans—but
you’re in the clouds?”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>II</h3>

<p class='c010'>Silas was with Lady Malleson, more than usually
morose. She lay upon the sofa, while he prowled
up and down the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dene, you scarcely speak to me to-day?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>(“She cringes,” he thought with pride.)</p>

<p class='c008'>“My sister-in-law’s in love,” he replied tersely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“With whom has she fallen in love?” asked Lady
Malleson, thinking how strange it was that she
should be thus intimately conversant with a group
of work-people down in the village.</p>

<p class='c008'>“With Morgan,—the young zany.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, you always seemed so fond of him! your
one human frailty,” she bantered. But he rounded
on her with unwarrantable sharpness. “I think
your ladyship is mistaken: I never remember saying
I was fond of Morgan. They’re neither of
them any more alive than a turtle-dove sunning itself
in a wicker cage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You strange creature—have you <i>no</i> natural
affections?” she said, with indolent curiosity. “None
for that young man, who really devotes himself
to you? none for your little harmless sister-in-law?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m nothing to them—only a blind man to whom
they’re kind out of their charity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe, Silas, that you are so bleak as
you make out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My own solitude, my lady, is my own choosing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why shouldn’t you accept what comfort those
two young things could give you?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“It’s weak,” he burst out, “why not stand alone?
why depend on another? Why shouldn’t the
strength of one suffice? Why all this need to double
it? Love’s wholly a question of weakness; the
weaker you are, the more desperately you love. A
prop.... Love’s the first tie for an independent
man to rid himself of. It’s a weakness that grows
too easily out of all proportion. I want my mind for
other things, not for anything so trite. So well
charted. So ... so recurrent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Another theory, Silas? Be careful,” she lazily
teased him; “what we most abuse, you know, is
often what we most fear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall break them,” he growled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What! your sister-in-law? that frail-looking little
thing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She, and ... her lover.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silas, you scare me sometimes, you speak so
savagely.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Scare you, my lady? even you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why ‘even me’?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve explored me,” he said grudgingly; “you
know me so well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do I? everything about you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not quite,” he said, in a tone of profound gloom.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“Do you know yourself, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To the depths,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you enjoy having such complete self-knowledge?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s lonely,” he said, his face drawn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lonely, but you have <i>me</i> now to talk to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, your ladyship is very kind and gracious,”
he said, with the deferential manner he sometimes
abruptly assumed, and through which she always
uncomfortably suspected the sarcasm; “I am very
grateful to your ladyship. But your ladyship....”
and thus far he preserved his deference, but abandoned
it now to exclaim as though tormented,
“You’re a whetstone to my disquiet; you taunt me,
you keep all peace from me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never knew you wanted peace.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was tired and dispirited that day, and had
been dwelling upon his blindness; he craved for
peace, for some one to give him peace!—and she
knew it. But she must whip and provoke him back
to the strain of his old attitude. She did not know
what urged her to say as she did, in her most sneering
tone, “I never knew you wanted peace.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nor I do,” he snarled; “I wouldn’t have it as a
gift.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>
  <div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>III</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>So they wrangled always; indispensable she might
be to him, but peace was certainly not what she
brought him. And although they maintained the
disguise afforded by her tone of slight condescension,
and by his of conventional respect, underneath
this disguise fomented the perpetual and manifold
contest, of class against class, of the rough against
the fastidious, of the man against the woman. She
had very little real fear that its full strength would
ever break over her,—little real fear, only enough
to provide the spice she exacted. She trusted to
her appraisement of him: too proud to risk a rebuff;
too fiercely recalcitrant under the thongs of affection.
Under their menace he snorted and reared,
while she laughed indolently, and incited him to further
indignations. Yet she held him, she held him!
and though she knew full well that she fretted and
exasperated him, she held him still; seeing his struggles,
but toying with him, pretending to let him go,
pulling him back, distracting and confusing his spirit
that was always beating round in the search for escape;
and all the while she heard from various quarters
the pleasant flattery of her guilt extolled under
the name of charity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll be happy soon: you’ll have the spring,”
Silas said to Nan. He did not speak with the customary
note of derision in his voice,—this was the
newer Silas,—but she thought she detected it very
painstakingly concealed.</p>

<p class='c008'>She went away from him, and her going was after
the manner of a flight. Had she followed her impulse,
she would have gone running, with her head
bent down between her protecting hands. It seemed
that she could keep nothing from Silas; he laid his
grasp without mercy upon her shyest secrets. She
had tried to keep her joy in the coming spring a
secret; although reserve was hard of accomplishment
to her, she had achieved it, hiding her delight away
in her heart, or so she believed, not knowing that
her laughter had rung more clearly, or that she had
been singing so constantly over her work in the two
cottages. She was conscious of no impatience and
no desires. She would not, by a wish, have made
herself a month older. She was happy now, she
told herself, because the country would presently
become a refuge from the factory, instead of its
dismal and consonant setting, wide and level as the
sea itself, in its centre the sinister hump of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>abbey and the factory. By walking a little way in
the opposite direction, and turning her back upon
the village, she would dismiss the factory and look
across the liberated country, as it was impossible to
do in these days when the floods accompanied the
factory for miles around as a reflection of its spirit.
She told herself that she wanted nothing more.
She knew that she could be happy,—perhaps not
indefinitely, but she did not look far ahead, the
present was too buoyant and suspended,—happy for
the moment if Silas would but leave her alone.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>V</h3>

<p class='c010'>For a few days he kept up his new smooth-spoken
tone; it was “little Nan” this, and “little Nan” that,
and whenever he could get hold of her hand he
stroked and patted it, and joined his fingers round
her wrist, saying that it was fragile. “You’re very
slight, Nan,” he said, feeling her arm and shoulder,
and once he laid one hand against her chest and the
other against her back, and said that there was no
thickness in her body. She withdrew herself, shuddering,
from his touch. “I’m blind, you know,” he
whined, and then laughed, “Bless you, blind or not
blind, I know any of you in the room before you’ve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>spoken; there’s very little Silas doesn’t know. I
know all about you, Nan, and I’m a good friend to
you, too.” “But Silas ...” she began desperately.
“Hush!” he said, putting his fingers to her lips and
looking mysterious, “no need to say anything; we
understand one another.” Just then Linnet Morgan
came in, throwing aside his cap, and Nan clasped
her hands in terror lest Silas should continue. “Linnet?”
said Silas instantly, “you’re back early to-day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Linnet had work which could as easily be done
at home. He began at once getting books and papers
out of his cupboard, and disposing them on the
table. He and Nan observed one another stealthily
and quickly; he saw that she wore her dark red
shirt and black skirt, and that on his entrance she
had become silent as though confused, but meanwhile
he talked to Silas and made him laugh, and
ran his fingers backwards through his hair. Nan
noticed that his crisp hair was quite golden at the
roots, and that a fine white line followed the beginning
of its growth. He was very fair-skinned, and
the back of his neck where it disappeared into his
collar was covered with a fine golden down. He was
always busy; when he was not working he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>talking and laughing; Nan supposed that he had
never in his life had time to think about himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s something I’ve always wanted to know,”
began Silas, resting his arms upon the table as
though he were watching Nan and Linnet, “what
were you two doing here the night Martin came?
while I was at the Abbey?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The night the donkey was maimed?” asked Morgan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, fancy you remembering that!” said Silas
negligently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was clearing up, and we talked for a bit,” Nan
put in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There was nothing to clear up; it was Sunday
evening and you’d been singing and playing your
zither. You talked mostly,—now, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?” asked Morgan. He was very rarely
sharp in speech, but he saw Nan’s discomfort.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not, indeed? you and Nan are much of an
age,” Silas replied. They considered him wonderingly;
was he well-intentioned or infinitely malign?
As they considered him he got up and went towards
the stairs. “Back in a moment,” he said. They
heard his tread upon the steps, then moving overhead.
They looked at one another.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“Why did you say that about the donkey?” Nan
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You think, like me, that Silas did it,” he answered,
as a statement. “Don’t look so frightened,”
he went on, his eyes softening into his ready smile;
“I assure you, you need never be frightened of
Silas. There’s no muscle in his violence. Nothing
will ever come of it—beyond maiming donkeys. Oh
yes, it’s horrible, I know, because it’s so futile. No,
don’t shake your head—your pretty head,” he added
inaudibly. An impulse came over him to cry
“You tiny thing! you slip of fragility!” but he repressed
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>She uttered the most treacherous remark she had
ever breathed about Silas, something which fringed
the frightful truth, “I know better,” then terrified
of her indiscretion, added, “Oh no, I mean nothing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are afraid of him, aren’t you?” he said,
coming round the table closer to her, his attitude
very sympathetic and protective, and differing by a
shade from Calthorpe’s attitude. “You must not be
that. One can only be sorry for Silas, who has
grown warped and crooked, and who talks because
there is nothing else he can do. Whenever I think
of Silas, I feel so lucky in mind and body.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>She glanced at him gratefully. He had had the
tact not to urge an explanation of her injudicious
remark, and she knew that she could always depend
upon this gentle tact; moreover, he had rescued her
soul from the terror she so dreaded, and had by his
words set Silas in a sane and pitiful light. It suited
her temperament to have Silas drawn down from
the uncomfortable heights where he seemed to dwell
in perpetual strife with elements. It was no longer
Silas who brooded over them, but they who endured
and even loved Silas with widened charity. She
was very grateful to Linnet for this. What he had
done once he could do again; he could soothe her
terrors. She had not yet thought of him in so human,
companionable a way.</p>

<p class='c008'>He continued the line that he had taken up, giving
her time to command herself fully, making no demands
upon her and pretending that nothing had
been amiss. He swung himself on to the table, and
talked easily,—</p>

<p class='c008'>“I feel so lucky and thankful for having whole
limbs and a sane mind. I don’t covet genius, but
I do covet sanity; in fact, I’m not sure that the
broadest genius isn’t the supreme sanity. Balance
and justice! I think those two things are magnificent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and grand,” (but he himself, she knew,
would in practice always be merciful rather than
just).</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I had your book-learning,” she said; “you
ought to stick to books.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no,” he replied, “I like chemistry better, and
those things. Science.... If I hadn’t to earn my
living I shouldn’t be working on scents in this factory.
No! I’d be in a country cottage with a
laboratory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You do your best as it is,” she said, touching his
stack of scientific books.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had a bit of training at Edinburgh University,”
he said, in wistful reminiscence, “but one ought to
dedicate years....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who was your father?” she asked after much
deliberation whether she might venture the question.
She knew Morgan only as an isolated person, who
had arrived one day into the world of the factory,
and had never mentioned home or relations. She
knew only that he was Scotch; he had a very slight
Scotch accent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He was an Inverness crofter,” he replied
vaguely, “I used to keep the sheep on the hills in
mists and snows, and properly I hated it. The days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>were short, and I thought it was always winter. I
used to sit shivering on the brae-side, huddled in a
plaid for shelter under a boulder, trying to read
while I kept one eye on the sheep. The pages of my
book used to get damp and limp, and the print got
blurred when I tried to dry the page with the corner
of my jacket. Then somebody found out that I
wasn’t getting any education, and reported it, so I
was sent back to school, and was happy again. And
you—you haven’t lived here always, have you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Since I was ten,” she replied, sighing, “we used
to live in the south before that ... I liked that,”
she said, “it was a pretty place, Midhurst, near
Arundel—perhaps you know it?” She thought innocently,
and rather in the fashion of a child, that
every one must know what she knew.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I did, but I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, it’s under the Downs. Do you remember
the day we walked with Silas to Thorpe’s Howland?
that put me in mind of Midhurst; there were woods
round about Midhurst.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You enjoyed yourself that day, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He expected a little burst of rhapsody from her,
but she only said quietly, “Yes, I did,” and he was
aware of disappointment, and at the same time of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>the little stinging charm of her occasional unexpectedness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We both come from sheep country, then,” he
said, but the images evoked in their minds were
different: his of rough hills with their summits lost
in mist, and lochs lying amongst the windings at
their base; of dirty huddled flocks swept by wind
and sleet; while hers were of cropped downland
under a blue and white open sky, with the shadows
of the clouds bowling across the downs and over the
clumps of trees and little church-steeples in the valleys.
He realised the disparity, saying “When I
say that, we see different pictures,” and he smiled,
but in his heart he longed for their childhood to have
run side by side either in the Sussex or the Highland
village. “Have you ever been back there?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no; it’s a long way from Lincolnshire. I was
always at the factory after I left school, and then
when I was eighteen Mother died and I married.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only eighteen?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A week after my birthday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How young!” he said, with such rich and wondering
compassion that she looked suddenly as it
were into the depths of a cool inexhaustible well,
always at hand for the quenching of her thirst. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>was sitting on the table near her, while their conversation
flowed on in its effortless interest, so that
time and his books were forgotten. He seemed
quite absorbed in what they were saying, looking
down at her with intent consideration. They had
attained an intimacy in which they could talk untroubled;
she found it very precious.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, Linnet!” said Silas’s bantering voice,
“making love to my sister-in-law?”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>VI</h3>

<p class='c010'>Silas became unwontedly withdrawn into himself,
neither Nan nor Morgan knew what to make of him.
At times he avoided them, at other times silently
sought their company. Gregory, to whom Nan
turned, after one glance at his brother, replied, “Let
him alone,” and she followed the brief formula as
being the best advice, finding that Silas only snarled
at her whenever she spoke to him. She was relieved
rather than dismayed; Silas surly was preferable to
Silas honeyed.</p>

<p class='c008'>He roamed alone, spending hours in the abbey
after dusk; or ordered up Hambley, and under the
little man’s guidance made his way to the secluded
summer-house at Malleson Place. Lady Malleson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>was also at a loss to understand his altered manner;
towards her he relaxed his taciturnity, and his speech
was more than ever wild and varied, but although he
ranged erratically she had the impression that his
mind rarely departed from one central subject, and
she had also the shrewd idea that that subject was
his little sister-in-law, whom she had once seen, and
whom she vaguely thought a pretty, delicate, rather
appealing girl, unimportant until she had become the
preoccupation of Silas’s thoughts.</p>

<p class='c008'>So long as she had Silas with her, however, she
cared very little what he talked about. The utmost
that she deplored, sometimes, was his restlessness.
It made her wonder whether she really held him.
She wondered, indeed, sometimes whether her hold
on him was too light to satisfy her vanity, or too
secure—all too secure!—for the preservation of her
safety and her convenience. She liked danger well
enough, but there was a point where danger might
become too dangerous.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wild man,—Ishmael,” she said to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he went on regardless with what he had
been saying.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s but one use for the body,” he exclaimed,
“health. Not mortification—that’s morbid. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span><i>health</i>, lean and hard. Sinews like whips.” He
bared a magnificent forearm. “The only instance
where I practise what I preach,” he added bitterly,
causing the muscles to rise at will.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you should respect your brother Gregory,”
she said, languidly content.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have seen him lately, my lady?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yesterday, in the village.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The neatest of minds, in the body of a blacksmith,”
said Silas.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Neat?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, yes—so long as he doesn’t break out.
Then he lays all around him, smashes everything he
can see, without comment—that makes it quite uncanny,
I assure you—and in a trice returns to
his quiet and his neatness as though nothing
out of the way had happened. He’s very inaccessible,
my brother Gregory. No warnings. No
explanations. No remorse. Nothing apparently,
but action.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You respect that,” she said, looking at his fine
bony face, and his thick rough hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think, if a man’s killed,” he brooded, “killed by
violent means, what an outrage on the body. Blood
spilt, that ran secretly and private in his veins.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Bones, no one had ever seen. Entrails. What a
bursting!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She pictured his mind as a landscape ravaged by
war, here a wreckage of stone and twisted iron,
there a grave, here the stark Calvary of a stricken
tree, there the bright blare of poppies striving for
life amongst the rushes and rank weeds.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You waste yourself,” she said; “you should be a
martyr,—or a poet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She liked to stir him, by such calculated remarks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A second-rate poet? not I,” he sneered instantly;
then, as the flattery stole over him, “More likely a
martyr, of the two,” he said, responding.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You waste yourself,” she repeated, drawing
meanwhile slowly through her fingers the long silk
fringe of a shawl that lay thrown across her sofa,
“you waste yourself, out of contempt. You eagle
with broken wings!”—she knew with what gluttony
he accepted such metaphors, and amused herself
when he wasn’t with her by thinking out new ones
that she might serve up to him,—“you repudiate
comfort, don’t you, in your dream of grandeur.
Will you end, I wonder, by getting neither?” “No
one speaks to me like your ladyship,” he muttered
reluctantly. She laughed. She enjoyed pretending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>to an ideal of him that, his pride well fired, he would
strain himself to live up to; an ideal, moreover, that
coincided so adroitly with his own ideal of himself.
“I never knew a man so vigorously reject the second-best.
It was a pity,” she continued, smoothing out
and patting down the fringe of the shawl, “that you
never came across a woman to suit you.” She raised
her eyes to watch him as she talked, and modulated
her phrases according to the expression she found
on his face, nor did she trouble to conceal the busy
mischief in her own; there were advantages, certainly,
in his blindness. “How would you have behaved,
I wonder?” she went on; “you would have
made a stormy lover, I fancy, once your resistance
had been thrown to the winds. Stormy and exacting.
Poor woman! Yet I dare say she wouldn’t
have minded. Women are like that, you know.
And for you,—no more loneliness, no more unsatisfied
longings, no more misanthropy. I believe you’d
have grown into a different man. You would probably
have achieved a good deal.... But it would
have taken a clever woman, a very clever woman, to
steer you without your knowing that you were being
steered.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Women in my walk of life don’t have time for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>cleverness, my lady,” he said acrimoniously, giving
a literal answer to her words because he must ignore
the meaning which he read into them, and which,
as he well knew, she had intended him to read. Her
ingenuity was tireless over insinuations that put him
on the rack. Clever, she had said; she was clever
enough! why hadn’t they, he wondered, appointed
women to sit upon the tribunals of the Inquisition?
“If you had been born into my class, or I into yours
...” he burst out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t admit impertinence, you know, Dene,”
she said in a voice of ice, “and anyway I am afraid
I cannot give you any more time at present.”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>VII</h3>

<p class='c010'>Thus, always. He hated his bondage, he despised
while he coveted the woman, he hated her for holding
him bound, but nothing, nothing was comparable
to his hatred and disgust of himself in his
inability to get free. Often he raved audibly, shaking
his fists; and those who saw him stopped to
listen to his mutterings, and thought what an alarming
sight Silas Dene presented, with his wild blind
eyes and furrowed mouth that mumbled and let
drop the tiny river of saliva. He was often to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>seen thus in the abbey, of an evening, prowling in
the aisles; where occasionally on a Sunday he would
be perceived by the rare visitor attracted to Abbot’s
Etchery, that strange island of factory and Norman
abbey emerging amidst the floods, sufficiently
singular to be worth the journey out from Lincoln;
and those who saw him there went away saying
that not the least arresting sight in the desolate encampment
was the blind man who in savagery and
loneliness haunted the precincts of the abbey, and
whose incoherent ravings could be readily changed
by a little encouragement into a tirade of such
vehemence, such angry bitterness, such bewildering
aggression. They went away wondering what ailed
him, to have made of him so baffling and solitary a
figure.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>VIII</h3>

<p class='c010'>Rumour, at the same time, began to trot like a
jackal round the figure of Silas. There was the
incident, never very clear to the village, of the fire.
Loyalty of course silenced Nan and Morgan; and
Hambley, to a very large extent silenced through
fear, dared do no more than drop hints that Silas
could scarcely trace back to him. Nevertheless, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>taste of the story got about, a taste that the village
relished and rolled over on its tongue, both in the
workshops and the public bar,—for gossip that
penetrated the fiercely secluded house of the Denes,
and brought to light even the tip of one of their
buried secrets, had a legendary smack denied to
topics more vulgar and more frequently accessible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Also, Lady Malleson’s name was murmured, behind
the shelter of a raised hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nan was aware of the curious looks, thrown at
her because she had been with Silas during the fire;
and Morgan, aware of similar looks, met them with
a contemptuous impatience; but Silas for some days
knew of nothing amiss. Only when he stood up to
speak at the debating-club, down in the concert-room,
he heard a murmur pass through his audience,
a murmur of resentment and disapproval. It was as
though the accumulated resentment of the men, repressed
hitherto out of a lack of understanding, a
certain awe, and even a grudging admiration, had
now broken its bonds under a definite provocation
that had submerged their submission by arousing
their disgust. It was a low murmur, compounded of
irritation, criticism, and of mutiny under a tyranny
they no longer respected and were therefore no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>longer prepared to admit. Silas heard it, and with
his fist already lifted for his peroration, stopped
himself dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>He faced them, standing alone under the dark
frown of many sulky and rebellious looks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some one spoke?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was accustomed to exact silence when he took
up the debate.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had very little time to decide his course of
action; he knew that they were against him; knew,
obscurely, why; and dared not press home the question.</p>

<p class='c008'>Morgan was not present, or he might have tided
over the matter, out of pity for Silas, who in his
defiance looked so extraordinarily gaunt and solitary,
and so undefeatably proud.</p>

<p class='c008'>Morgan, however, was busy elsewhere, so that
Silas faced only a lowering throng, that sat obstinate,
chins thrust forward into palms and murmured
still, with deliberate intent to affront, but without
the courage to bring clear accusation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This isn’t the treatment I’m accustomed to receive
here,” Silas bayed at them finally, “and until
I’m invited I’ll no longer trouble you. Invited I
said, and invited I meant. If I’m sought up at my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>own house perhaps I’ll reconsider it, and come back
to you. For the present, good-night to you all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>One, more kind-hearted than the rest, and perhaps
ashamed, rose clumsily to intercept him as he went
towards the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll help you, Dene.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas thrust him aside, and strode away alone.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>IX</h3>

<p class='c010'>When this story had come to the ears of Nan and
Morgan, they whispered “The fire!” and crept away
from one another sooner than disturb a subject of
which they could not bear to speak.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fire had taken place at night, and had not
been in itself of any importance. “You see nothing
but a few tarred sheds burning,” Silas had cried, in a
frenzy of desperation to Morgan, “and folk will
come to me to-morrow to say you acted gallantly,
or what not. Why shouldn’t you, seeing only wood
and flames? You don’t hear it coming after you
with great light strides and flaming fingers....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silas, you’re afraid,” Morgan had said
gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas had checked himself at that; he had
quavered, and made an effort to recover. The accusation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>had fallen like a plummet into the uncontrolled
waters of his mind. He had quavered, and almost
gibbered at Morgan; so greatly fallen beneath his
normal standard of pride and independence that he
had been shocking to hear and see. He had tried to
defend himself, “Not afraid, only helpless, helpless....”</p>

<p class='c008'>Nan and Morgan had stood, hearing him beseech
them not to leave him. Nan knew then that Silas
was betrayed by fear into revealing something he
usually kept very, very carefully concealed; that
was why the exposure was so shocking and so
degrading; and Morgan seeing it with her eyes
stood beside her, both equally hurt, and equally
craving to rescue Silas. But he, in his mingled
panic and resentment, had had nothing but insults
for them, and, nearly screaming, told Morgan to
clear out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shall I stay with you?” Nan had asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had hesitated; he wanted to fling her out,
he tried to make himself say, “No, go!” but his
extreme terror was stronger than this flicker of
his other, antagonistic. He said, “Yes, you can
stay,” a heat of hatred for her passing over him as
he said it.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>
  <div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>X</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>They had sat in silence after Morgan had gone,
because Silas had forbidden her to speak. She was
glad of the hush, for she felt that she had passed
through a great empty din and that the brass vacancy
of cymbals was still clanging in her ears. The scene
had wounded her, and had roused emotions that
bewildered her. Why should she resent (to the
extent of stretching out deterrent hands, as she had
done,) the betrayal of Silas by himself? Somewhere,
though she would neither have probed nor acknowledged,
she had believed that underneath her fear
and pity lay hatred of Silas; she had even tried to
extend her pity into a reassuring mental scorn. Yet
to him, who never spared others, she had had the
impulse to cry, “Spare yourself.” She had suffered
from seeing him untrue to his own tradition.</p>

<p class='c008'>They sat in silence, Silas tearing at the seat of a
rush-bottomed chair, Nan watching the unequal
glow in the sky outside the windows. She found
herself trembling from time to time. Not with fear
of the fire, but with disgust and regret of that noisy
scene. She wished that something would happen to
restore him to his ancient formidable credit, something
to remove that disquieting sense of his fraudulence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>She turned away from him, but next moment
was glancing at him again; he was destroying the
seat of the chair, shred by shred, his fine hands pulling
at the rushes with a peevish haste and his head
bent obstinately away from observation. Every time
a siren hooted he hunched himself more closely together,
as though the compression of his limbs
would afford him some protection.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think the glare is dying down, Silas,” she said
gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>He hunched himself fretfully away.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was thinking, “They are full of forbearance
and long-suffering. Am I to be taught gratitude?
perhaps through disaster? They would let God
himself look into every corner of their minds. Little
children!” For the moment, under the effect of his
fear, he did not brand them as lacking in savour.
Their limpidity seemed to him as desirable as the
absence of danger. If danger might but be removed
he would abandon as the price his own arrogant passions.
He was humbled now to another standard
of life. Weary of battle and opposition, peace appeared
to him sweet and seemly, now that he had
been granted tumult,—a tumult not of his own making,
and entirely out of the control of his stage-managing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>He thought again, “They have never
a quick word against me. Nan gave me a stick,
and I broke it and said I wanted no stick, because
I knew she expected me to show pleasure. I am
sure that after I broke it she had tears in her eyes.
But why should she try to coax me with presents?
or I allow myself to be coaxed?” He shuddered at
the long scream of a siren, and reflected that they
had probably kept the extent of the fire from him,
knowing that he could not verify. For an instant
he caught hold of the idea that the fire might get
across the village to the abbey, and destroy that; and
a little flash of old wicked glee passed across him.
But it died away. He imagined the fire travelling
down his own street, men and women flying before
it, and he himself forgotten, engulfed,—perhaps
even purposely left to perish. At this point he spoke,
“Are you there, Nan?” She was there. “I never
meant you any harm, Nan,” he said surprisingly.
Warm-hearted, she was at his side as the words left
his lips. “No, Silas, I know that....” “That’ll do,”
he said pushing her away.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he had now started upon another train of
thought, which he adopted and amplified with his
usual vehemence. “God preserve me, and I will live
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>to befriend Nan and Linnet.” Obscurely he had the
instinct of propitiation, offering his intention as a
bribe to a very angry god; and partially in his
chastened mood,—albeit but the vile chastening of
terror,—he yielded to the stirrings of his own repressed
sentimentalism. Simplicity, limpidity, were
perhaps not the poor and bloodless attributes he
had thought. Their case might be turned convincingly
by a skilful advocate. He, Silas, had the mettle
of strife within him; those other two had not:
(The fire! the fire! in the meanderings of his arguments
he had almost forgotten the fire. In the rush
of recollection he knotted his fingers together till they
cracked. He was horribly afraid.) Those two did
not fight and wrestle with chimeras, muscles knotted
and sweat pouring, as Silas did. Their minds were
not ridden by demons. They did not sight everywhere
a portent, a dark enemy or a fiercely fair ally.
He had scorned them as easy, milky, satisfied,—he
knew well the run of the familiar epithets. He had
tried to scorn them; he had forsworn their kindness.
He had crushed his love for them, and his longing
to allow the warm tide of that love to flow in solace
over him. He had been proud, and had driven his
craft ever to sea, courting the gales and riot, rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>than accept the broad comfort of the haven. Proud!
proud! how superbly proud! how proportionately
base the physical fear that could humble such a spirit
of arrogance in man!</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>XI</h3>

<p class='c010'>A cry from Nan brought him to his feet, chattering.
“What it it? what is it?” in a renewed access
of fear. “Oh, Silas!” she exclaimed, coming close
to him, “there’s Hambley looking in through the
window; tell him to go away, oh, please tell him to
go away! He does what you tell him always.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hambley was indeed pressing his face against the
window, and the shape of his head was dark against
the red sky. He was so small that he was only just
able to reach the window by climbing to the outside
sill with the tips of his fingers, and the end of his
nose was flattened white upon the pane. Nan could
see the grin on his evil little face. Silas strode to the
door, flung it open, and summoned the little man.
At the end of the street the night was torn by flames.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as Hambley was inside he seized the little
man by his collar. “Now what were you doing,
peeping into my house when you thought you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>wouldn’t be found out? You little skunk, I’ve
always called you, and so you are. You frightened
Nan, you little skunk. You meant to spy upon me.
Well, you’ll see what you get!” Holding him easily
with one hand, sometimes swinging him clean off
his feet, so that he twirled and dangled in mid-air,
Silas thrashed him with his fist, and Hambley
shrieked and appealed to Nan, and tried, but quite
vainly, to kick Silas. Nan got into a corner, out of
the way of the blows. When he had finished, Silas
carried him over to the door and threw him regardlessly
out into the street.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>XII</h3>

<p class='c010'>Morgan came back at midnight, and said that the
fire was over, not having spread beyond the sheds.
He was rubbing his blackened hands on a piece of
waste. His eyes fell upon the litter of shredded
rushes scattered in witness on the floor near Silas.
Nan drooped, pale and tired. He began to tell her
about the fire, trying to brighten her and to make
her feel that she was no longer a prisoner alone with
Silas. He was purposely taking no notice of Silas,
but presently looked up to see the blind man standing
above them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>He appeared to be immensely tall and haggard,
and upon his face was a look of suffering, which by
the accentuation of furrow and wrinkle gave the
suggestion that he was unkempt. His limbs and
torso were hugely, grotesquely reproduced in shadow
upon the walls and ceiling behind him. Inscrutable
to them, he loomed over Nan and Linnet. At last
he spoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re glad to have him back, Nan. You’re
glad to come back to her, Linnet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Their eyes met in tremulous surprise; was Silas
to serve as their interpreter?</p>

<p class='c008'>“You little, dainty people! Oh, yes. I know.
Gentle in your dealings. Amiable. Indulgent.
You don’t criticise—criticism’s uncharitable—might
hurt somebody’s feelings. Let things remain as they
are; don’t disturb. Moderation! That’s your creed.
Make terms. Compromise!” He dropped ejaculations,
and swung into his most rhetorical vein, in
which he seemed really possessed by a spirit that
released the unfaltering words. “O pliant ones of
the earth! blessed are the meek, and flowers shall
revive at your passage. Wander into the woods;
call to the roe-deer to eat from your hand. Look
with envy at the pairing foxes, the nesting birds;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>no creature so wild that it may escape the yearly
call of home. If the fox and the vixen together can
burrow their earth for shelter and the whelping of
their litter, cannot you two together build a hut
of boughs and branches in a clearing beside the
stream? Listen: I covet no love, I am debarred;
and love when it touches men like me is no virtue,
only an indulgence of self and a lapse from
strength.” He laughed. “Who would be weak? or
bestial? But in you, love shall attain its highest
purpose of usefulness and steadfastness. To be
steadfast in love is reserved to man; it is the conscious
will of love, the sustained reason. Without
it, as well be a dog, and couple in the street. Are
you fit? You are young and your minds are counterparts;
you have no business with me or with
Gregory. Leave me to Gregory, and Gregory to me;
the dumb shall lead the blind, and the blind shall
speak for the dumb. But you, go out, where no
strife assails, and concern yourselves with labour.
You are the builders, and we are the destroyers; we
are the cursed, and you are the blessed. You and
your like must build your security upon the ruins of
us and our like; it’s the natural law. I might have
been another man, but God saw fit to twist me; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>wrenched my spirit and upon each of my eyes in turn
he laid a finger.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They sat absolutely speechless, confused and confounded
that he should thus trumpet out the secret
they had hitherto guarded from one another. They
had wondered and suffered and trembled much, but
of all outcomes this was an outcome they had certainly
never foreseen. It broke over them like a
natural catastrophe; Silas was making it into something
beyond the diapason of their souls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Build!” he said passionately, earnestly, “build
with your sanity and your health. Leave query and
destruction to the tormented spirits; there will always
be enough of those; and if you did but know,—oh,
world!” he said, clasping his hands, “if you
did but know, you would pity the precursor, solitary
and bold. Then comes the army of the workers,
with honest tools, and their flowing quietness.—Why
should you struggle, you two, beside Gregory
and me? You should be side by side, perfectly
matched, amongst children who should resemble you.
Tell me,” he said, bending down to them, “you love?”</p>

<p class='c008'>When he reduced it to those naked terms, they
were ashamed into honesty, both towards him and
towards each other; they assented, as though he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>were a priest reading over them a terrible and simple
marriage-service.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you shall have the courage to love. You
shall go unmolested. You were intended to fulfil,
not to renounce. Who pretends to one law for all?
Not I; I wouldn’t dare utter such a heresy of intolerance.
Not in my sane moments. Who would
take a field-bird up into the mountains? His place
is simpler; sweeter....”</p>

<p class='c008'>He suddenly put his hands over his face, and his
voice faltered, as though he were spent and had
nothing more to say.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go away now,” he said fretfully, “I’m tired out.”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>This wound, this gash, to be exposed to the village!
How greedily they would lick up his blood!
they would set upon him with claw and fang as
upon a lion brought low. No delight could equal
the delight over the dictator shamed, or the eagerness
with which those in subjection would pounce
upon the infallible taken in fault. But, while knowing
the story of the fire to be common gossip, he
would grant no concessions; he stalked about the
streets in challenging pride, more than usually unkempt,
more than usually fierce, an object of whispered
comment for all those who had expected him
to keep himself at last within bounds. It was noticed
that when spoken to, he threw back his head
as though it had been crowned with a mane, and his
answers were too haughty to be set down as the
cheaper insolence. The men were a little impressed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>but to give themselves determination they continued
to mutter against him. Calthorpe knew it, and was
concerned. He hinted something to Sir Robert
Malleson, but Malleson had received an anonymous
letter which disturbed and occupied every energy
of his mind, and was unsympathetic. The only
person with whom Calthorpe could get a hearing
was Mr. Medhurst, who called at Silas’s cottage,
and came away saying blandly that Dene was an
altered being. Why had Calthorpe so distressed
himself over Dene’s state of mind, and the attitude
of the village? He could not understand. Calthorpe
in his kind-heartedness had surely been mistaken.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Dene, I am very happy to find you in so
Christian a spirit.” Poor Mr. Medhurst suffered
greatly from the trap of his phraseology; it made all
intercourse with his fellows a source of self-consciousness
so acute that he felt justified in counting
every visit as a mortification. Yet he was unable
to control it. Visits to Silas Dene were a special
mortification; he had to pray for strength before
setting out, and now Mrs. Gregory Dene, a good
little soul, was not there to help him. “Of course,
you are a church-goer; I often see you in the abbey,”
Mr. Medhurst pursued.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Yes, sir,” Silas replied gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You seem to prefer the evening services? Ah
well, I dare say they fit in better with your work.”
Silas made no reply, but sat smiling to himself.
Mr. Medhurst started another topic, “What pretty
flowers you have always in here, Dene.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir, my sister-in-law does that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She must be a great comfort to you, Dene, since
... well, since you have been by yourself ... you
know....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Since my wife was killed, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well ... yes; yes, after all, that is what I
meant. I should like to say, Dene, that I admire
extremely the courage you have displayed under
your sorrow; I think I may claim that I am not
unobservant—although, God knows, sorely wanting
in other qualities, I add in all humility. I will confess
that your conduct at the inquest impressed me
most painfully, but we need not dwell upon that;
since then I have had nothing but praise for your
demeanour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed, sir?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, indeed. I was saying so to Sir Robert
Malleson only the other day. It gives me great
pleasure to say so to you now. You are a brave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>man, Dene.” He pronounced the words “brave
man” separately and with emphasis, and allowed a
suitable emotion to rise through his tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not at all, Dene, not at all. It is only your due.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, sir, perhaps we all have liftings towards
honour,” said Silas demurely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“H’m!” said Mr. Medhurst. What strange
phrases the man employed! “Liftings towards
honour.” What could that mean? But he was certainly
quieter; quieter and better-mannered, and his
frequent presence at evening service was a hopeful
sign, though Mr. Medhurst had noticed with a vague
misgiving that he took no part in the responses.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>II</h3>

<p class='c010'>Two days after the fire Silas received a summons
from Lady Malleson, a summons that he had been
expecting because he knew Malleson was away. It
was brought to him not by Hambley as usual (that
was scarcely surprising), but by Emma, Lady Malleson’s
maid. Would he come immediately? she,
Emma, was to bring him back. “I’ll wait for you,
Mr. Dene; you’ll be wanting to brush up a bit,” she
said, looking at his dirty hands and untidy hair, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>he scoffed at the suggestion and said that they should
start at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>In his impatience he forced the maid to a great
pace, dragging her along rather than allowing her to
lead him. She kept exclaiming that he would stumble
over roots and rabbit-holes as they crossed the
park, but he brushed her caution aside. “You’re
very particular not to keep her ladyship waiting,”
said she meaningly, not appreciating this walk with
blind Dene, of whom so many strange tales were
told. Little Hambley had been seen that morning
up at Malleson Place, scowling and limping in the
stable-yard, and the grooms with much relish had
said that Silas Dene had given him a thorough
thrashing. Little Hambley had, of course, not
owned to it. He had snapped viciously in reply to
their chaff. Emma longed to ask Silas whether the
story was true, but as no one ever asked questions
of Silas, she, like many others, held her tongue.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>III</h3>

<p class='c010'>He was taken up to the sitting-room, introduced
by the maid, and left just inside the door, as on the
occasion of his first visit. But now he knew the way
about the room.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“In the house to-day, my lady?” he said, “I like
the garden-house better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you want your own way, as usual?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You say that as though you hated me,” he said,
stopping dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a sensitive ear you have,” she replied
cruelly. “I do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a finality about this pronouncement
which caused him to take it with the utmost seriousness.
Her tones were chill and bloodless and dead,
and they disquieted him, so much that he advanced
not another step, but remained readjusting his mood,
which had been eager, to one of defence. He was
horribly startled. It was fortunate for him that
he could not see her; she had retreated from him as
far as the size of the room would allow, behind the
sofa, where she stood shivering as though with cold,
her eyes fixed and unblinking, her hand laid upon
her loose garment to hold it close at the throat, and
all her muscles gathered ready for swift escape at
any sign of advance on his part.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should not have sent for you,” she said, “but I
knew you could not read a letter if I wrote you one,
and I did not care to send you a message through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>any of my servants. I don’t want to keep you long,
as I only want to tell you that I am leaving for London
to-morrow and shall not be seeing you again. I
could certainly have sent you a message to tell you
that. But I wanted to tell you my reason myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She had prepared beforehand what she intended
to say, for her safeguard lay in frigidity of speech,
and to achieve that she must maintain frigidity of
feeling. That had been easy before he came; but
when she saw him her cold anger had been shaken,
her contempt had wavered beneath a return of her
old respect, and her audacity in risking danger had
revived. “I wanted to tell you my reason,” she
resumed, “but before doing so I must own that you
had completely taken me in. I thought I knew you
well, but I knew only that part of you which you
were willing that I should know. I thought I had
made in you the discovery of something really
rather remarkable. I was rather pleased with myself
over it. I know now that I have been stupidly
mistaken. Your elaborate fraud deceived me as
being a genuine thing....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can see you have learnt all this by heart,” he
interrupted. She flamed up no less at his perspicacity
than at his rudeness.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“Very well,” she cried, “I’ll drop my stilted
phrases. I did prepare them, but they are true, for
all that. I have found you out. You interested me,
you even impressed me,—I hate you for it. You’re
nothing but a sham and a coward.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s not true,” said Silas, growing very pale.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s so true,” she said quickly, “that the words
I’ve just used to you are the very words you have
always most dreaded hearing. A sham and a coward.
You’re such a coward that there have been moments
when you were glad you were blind, because that
saved you from dangers other men were expected to
undertake. You were quite safe to talk about danger;
your blindness sheltered you, and words
couldn’t possibly hurt. Am I not speaking the truth?
Your blindness has been your best friend, as well as
your worst enemy,—your worst enemy, because it
favoured your horrible imagination, and provided a
darkness that you peopled with shapes; your best
friend, because all the time it preserved you from
having to practise what you preached. See how I
know you now. I suppose it amused you to deceive
me, to see just how far you could go, and sometimes
when you thought you’d put your foot an inch over
the line of my credulity you drew it back very skilfully.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Now I have simply found you out for what
you are. I have learnt the story of the fire two
nights ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nan!” exclaimed Silas, in a burst of fury.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not at all; I have seen Hambley. I don’t wish
to make any mystery. He came to see me this morning,
whining and snivelling, and told me the whole
story: how you had lost your head, how you had
gibbered with fright—gibbered was the word he
used—he says you went like this,” and she imitated
a man in the extremity of terror, working her mouth,
distending her eyes and nostrils, and clacking her
fingers; “he was not pretty to watch, Dene. Then
he told me how you had dragged him in and beaten
him for looking in through your window; he was
quite shrewd enough to see that you seized upon the
pretext of beating him merely as a relief to your
nerves, that fright had exasperated. He came to
me in order to be revenged on you, and also, I think,
because he wanted to whimper to some one. He says
you went upon your knees to young Morgan, and
that Morgan was laughing at you, though you didn’t
know it, and that even your sister-in-law smiled
more than once behind her hand. Well, that’s the
picture I carry away of you, Dene. You can hardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>be surprised that I regret the kindness I have shown
to you. I have made a great mistake which I shall
know better than to repeat in the future.” She
hardened herself, she mentally insisted on her relief
at escaping from a situation which she had felt to
be getting beyond her control. There were many
incidents she remembered with discomfort, and her
husband had been very peremptory, when, the anonymous
letter in his hand, he had come to her, “If I
thought there was any truth in these revolting hints
...” yes, decidedly, Hambley’s revelations had been
very opportune as an excuse for getting rid of Silas.
She thought, on the whole, she had manœuvred her
opportunities ably.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hambley shall pay for this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hambley must take care of himself,” she replied,
“I have no doubt that you will invent some form of
revenge which will interest you very much as a new
experiment, and you will improve it and refine it
and fiddle over it, like some magician preparing a
brew. I should never, at any moment, have had
any doubts as to that. I should like you to understand
that I always knew you for cruel, unscrupulous,
and without heart or conscience; I thought you
a ruthless man, but where I went wrong was in not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>thinking you despicable. I could have respected you
for thorough-going villainy,—yes, I thought there
was a certain largeness of gesture about your discontent,—but
I have only contempt for the sham.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her voice had grown still more cold and level;
it licked sharply round his vanity, and as ever, his
instinct flew to physical violence. He snarled, and
moved in her direction, knocking over a small table,
but she dodged him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep quiet, Dene,” she said, in the same glacial
tone, “we really cannot play this ridiculous game of
blindman’s buff.”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>IV</h3>

<p class='c010'>He saw that he could do nothing against her, and
indeed was too proud to try. His pride had risen
correspondingly to his humiliation; he would show
her that something, at all events, in him was not a
sham. He was terribly, doubly hurt,—hurt in his
heart, and hurt, too, with the uneasy wound of
pride, his pride towards her, his pride towards himself.
All that she had said had been so true; she had
found the truth as a weapon, and had beaten him
with it across the face. He was so battered, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>gashed with scorn, that he was surprised to find
himself still alive and sentient. But he <i>was</i> sentient.
He <i>was</i> indomitable. His life was so strong that it
had not been knocked even temporarily unconscious.
It stirred: he spoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall say nothing to justify myself,” he began.
“If your ladyship wishes to think ill of me you must
do so, although I dare say I could alter your opinion.”
He was prompted to say this by a phrase
that had occurred to his mind, and which gave him
some private consolation, “I have, after all, murdered
my wife, defied God, and banished my own
son.” But he did not say these words aloud. “You
are of course free, my lady,” he went on, “to dismiss
me without being besought by me. You call
me a coward; you forget I have the courage to live
alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The egoism,” she amended.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No!” he said sharply, “it’s discipline, not inclination,
and it began when I was a boy, because I
wouldn’t have pity. Now it’s a habit. I’ve shut
myself off from pity. I’m well schooled.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that all you have to say?” asked Lady Malleson,
as he ceased.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you expect me to plead for mercy? You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>were quite right when you said you knew only the
part of me that I was willing for you to know. If
you had known everything, my lady, you might have
been startled.” He was nursing his secret phrase.
“But I plan very carefully what I shall betray to
different people. Being blind, I must invent things
to think about.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are a demon!” broke from Lady Malleson.</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas smiled a bitter, gratified smile; he had at
least succeeded in making her angry. Having done
so, could he reconquer her? Should he risk the
affront of failure? She was all he had. No! if
she cared so little, let her go. He would not submit
to being patronised, to being kept on sufferance
by the woman who alone had the privilege of twisting
the strings of his heart. If that privilege, so
grudgingly, so agonisingly accorded, were to be so
little esteemed, let her go! What matter? A loneliness
the more.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought at first that I would tell Emma to
bring you to the abbey,” she resumed, more quietly;
“I thought that the setting would please you and
satisfy your sense of histrionics. It would have
been so thoroughly Silasian. For you <i>are</i> histrionic,
aren’t you, Silas?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>“Perhaps,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You and I, sitting on two cane chairs, in the dark
abbey,” she went on, “while I poured out to you in
an undertone all my opinion of you, my new opinion,
for the first time, my true opinion, and then,
who knows? the organist might have come in to
practise, and so provided an accompaniment for
your answer. I really believe your answer would
have varied according to the music. It would tickle
you to sway your life on a dainty chance like that.
I wonder that I overcame the temptation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A great pity,” said Silas indifferently, but as
though he had allowed himself to be beguiled a
moment by the charm of the suggestion. She was
annoyed with herself; she felt that she had allowed
her irony to run away with her, to become a little
too wild, especially when he continued in a tone of
irreproachable conventionality, “I must now thank
your ladyship for the kindness shown in the past
and for the many hours I have been allowed to
spend at Malleson Place. I appreciate that it isn’t
many poor chaps like me that’s given the advantage.
It’s been a gift blown me by the ill wind of my
wife’s death and my blindness. Your ladyship has
a kind heart,—they all say so in the village when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>they hear of the favours shown to blind Dene.”
As he spoke he made small staccato movements
with his fingers, bearing a resemblance to the dart
of Gregory’s pencil in some minute alteration of his
designs, a family resemblance, that in its finicky
precision was equally incongruous to both brothers;
in Silas the gestures seem to indicate the finishing
touches to a work of art about to be laid aside; the
touches were given, possibly, with regret, but still
with a certain affectionate satisfaction, as to work
well done, and opportunely completed; (he marvelled
at himself even as he spoke and gesticulated); they
irritated Lady Malleson with a small, wiry irritation,
like some insignificant but exasperating physical
pain, causing her to forget what she had called the
grandeur of Silas, and to remember only the warped,
malicious artistry in which he appeared to take
delight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he changed; he towered; he dwarfed her;
all her superiority went in a flash.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen,” he said then, so suddenly that she had
the impression that he had stepped bodily out of a
disguise,—“Your interest in me may have been unreal
to you,—how could it have been otherwise?
You are a fine lady, you have been through many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>experiences; I’m a rough fellow, and I dare say
bitter and brutal enough....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You like to think yourself brutal, don’t you?”
she interjected.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Such as I was,” he said, “you had me; are you
proud of what you made of me?—Oh!” he said,
hearing her movement of impatience, “I won’t make
you discourse; only that question I wanted to ask
you: are you proud of what you made? Only this:
was I <i>so</i> unworthy of your ladyship? Have you
been sullied by my contact? Or have I, by God,”
he thundered at her, “been sullied by yours? I’m
not so sure. What are you wondering in your mind
now? whether you can trust me to go away and hold
my tongue? You think you won’t risk putting the
idea of indiscretion into my head; you probably
think it will come there quite soon enough by itself.
Are you any less of a coward than I? You need
have no anxiety, I’m not tempted to revenge myself
on you in that way,—you think of that, you’re preoccupied
with that, but do you think at all of what
you may have done to me? You picked me up
casually, and you think you can put me down in
the same way. But, between picking me up and
putting me down, you’ve worked on me; you don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>leave me quite the same as you found me; and I’m
not an easy metal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was frightened when he said that, and muttered
hurriedly, “I hope I haven’t done you any
harm.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“One doesn’t know what harm or good one does,”
he replied, “working-man or grand lady. You’ll go
your way. I’m asking you only whether you’ll remember
me with pride, or whether you’ll think of
yourself as one of the things that dragged me back,
when I was always trying to escape? I’m not strong,
you know. I’m not strong. I’m only cursed with a
spirit that’s totally beyond my strength.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t understand,” she said uneasily; she tried
to tell herself that he was making a great fuss; but
she could not get away from the idea that the “fuss”
was tragically weighted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re quite safe,” he said, with extraordinary
gentleness. “I never wanted to love, you know,
either you or any one else; I often told you so; but
it isn’t love that I abuse, only the weakness that
submits to it. And I have to acknowledge that you
are wise in getting rid of me. I’m all awry, you
know; misbegotten; and folk like me are better left
alone; their misfortune only rubs off on to other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>people. You are wise to protect yourself; that’s
always a wise thing to do. I could wish only that
you had done it earlier; you would have made it
easier for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The melancholy of his reproach surprised her into
saying, “Is it at this moment that you’re speaking
from your heart, or was it just now?” and she remembered
the sharp finicky gestures he had made
when he thanked her for the kindness she had shown
him. “To what extent are you theatrical?” she
asked, in a little outburst of bad temper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That isn’t a question I should answer, even if I
had the answer at the tip of my tongue,” he replied.
“You may think, if you choose, that I am never
sincere.” (She thought, “He is going back to his
old manner.” She was greatly thankful.) “Perhaps
I am no more sincere,” he continued, standing there,
“than any of your ladyship’s little gimcracks in this
room.” His reference to her gimcracks was not contemptuous;
he seemed rather to be translated into a
region where a large gentleness held sway. Ironically
enough, she thought that she had never seen
him before, although this was the last time she was
seeing him. A similar idea appeared to strike him
at the same moment, for he said, “All along, I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>fought against you, and tried to disguise myself
from you. It doesn’t matter now. I seem always to
be fighting,—floundering about,—don’t I? I wonder
whether I shall ever get away? away from myself?
Would your ladyship ring for Emma now?
I should like to go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She got up wearily and crossed the room to the
bell. He was standing there, no longer scathing,
but quiet, patient, and tired. She looked at him;
and, going swiftly to him, she caught his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen, Silas. Perhaps I’ve been too hasty.
Listen to me. Perhaps I need not dismiss you altogether
... I might reconsider....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” he brought out with extreme firmness, as
though he extorted from a long way off the last
tragic effort of an overstrained will.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As you please,” she said, dropping his hand, and
in her angry haste she threw open the door to urge
the maid who was coming to lead him away.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>Gregory still worked obstinately among the vats.
Calthorpe had tried to coax him away to the engine-rooms,
but got no more answer than a shake of the
head. In his secret mind, Gregory was preparing a
scheme, now nearly complete, that would reorganise
the whole working of the factory; he saw himself as
its originator and supervisor, and was far too proud
to accept a preliminary post as a unit among a number
of mechanics. He was living for the day when,
before an assembled board-meeting, he would lay
his designs upon the table; although he could not
explain them by speech, their beautiful precise simplicity
would explain itself while he stood aside,
arms folded, and read the effect upon the faces of
the directors. (He had tested some designs upon
Calthorpe,—not those designs, of course,—and the
overseer had been seriously impressed. Gregory
knew with calm certainty, untouched by diffidence,
that his work was good.) Perhaps he would take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Nan with him as interpreter to the board-meeting;
she was intelligent, her small fingers flew fast, and
it would be a compensation, in some guise, for the
hours he had spent away from her in abstraction
over his drawings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile, time progressing towards that day,
he worked in the gallery of vats. It was a sort of
grotesque vigil. He hated the nauseous, automatic
work, but obliged himself to keep to it with a
strength of mind that Silas wholly appreciated. Day
after day he climbed the long iron ladder to the upper
gallery, dressed in splashed and grimy overalls, and
renewed his occupation, trundling hand-barrows,
emptying an over-full or cooling an overheated vat.
When he had to do this he stripped to the waist, and
stirred and flacked the boiling slime with a weapon
shaped like a flail. Sweat ran from him, and in
the gaunt gallery of iron girders, amongst the vats
of moving yellow fat, the play of his shining muscles
and sculptural body stood out as a classical and
noble revelation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Regarding Nan as his chattel, he never wondered
whether he was or was not agreeable to her, and in
his egoism never noticed her sensitive wilting under
his caresses. His pride and his machines were personalities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>infinitely more living to him than the instrument
of comfort and pleasure that was his wife.
When he had married her, he had loved her in a
rough animal way, that never had in it a streak of
consideration or unselfishness; it had amused him to
possess as a toy something so weak, so little, and
so pretty, and in the first weeks of their marriage
he had devised games for his own satisfaction, to
pick her up between both hands and lift her till her
head touched the ceiling, or to catch her up and run
with her along the dyke—such eccentric sports, that
half frightened her, half pleased her instinct by his
display of strength. Then he had grown accustomed
to her flitting presence. He had ceased to raise his
head when she came into the room, or to finger with
wonderment her small hands, or to turn over with
derisive affection the ribbons, cottons, and odds and
ends in her work-box. She ceased to be so distinctly,
so newly, Nan, and became merely one of
the little knot of four living in the double-cottage,—himself,
Silas, Nan, and Hannah. He watched her
when he had nothing better to do, just as he watched
Silas or Hannah, or, nowadays, Linnet, but within
the vaults of silence his true life was turned inwards
upon himself.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>And Silas was studying him; Silas studying
Gregory! Communication between them was almost
non-existent; Silas could, indeed, write on a piece
of paper and Gregory could read the message, but,
beyond a clumsy finger-system relating only to elementary
practical matters,—names of objects, and
such,—Gregory was quite unable to converse with
Silas. Silas foresaw therefore that he would have
no means of judging the effects of his observations
on Gregory’s mind. But difficulties only whetted
his ingenuity. He needed an occupation and an
opiate as he had never needed them before,—not
that he allowed himself to own to this,—and the
double disaster he had undergone, far from humbling
him, stung him to a determination of mischief
that welcomed any obstacle as an additional employment
for his days. He stood at his work in the
shops, before a trestle table, making the square boxes
into parcels, and as he tied the string he fancied
that every knot secured a further mesh in the net
he was weaving round unsuspecting lives.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>II</h3>

<p class='c010'>But all the while he was gnawed by sorrow for
what he was doing. Nan! Linnet! so young, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>disarming! he knew he loved them both. In his
mind they were children. Could he but struggle
out of the deadly groove of perversity that held
him, could he but shake off the innumerable fetters
of his small malignities! As well hope to shake off
the physical cowardice that was his secret torment
and his shame. To rise! to escape! to leave behind
all the indignity of petulance and rancour! at times
he fancied almost that he could hear the beating of
great wings, and a kind of swoon overtook him,
as one who has fasted, or has remained too long
in mystic contemplation; but, emerging from it, he
was instantly wrapped up again in the cold craftiness
of his schemings, that tangled themselves round
him as surely as he would tangle them round others.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>III</h3>

<p class='c010'>He must forget Lady Malleson. He wished that
the cause of his disgrace could have been different;
those words, “a coward and a sham,” left a bad taste
in his mouth; there was no getting round them, and
no getting round the incident of the fire; he wished
passionately that the whole thing might be blotted
out: there was Nan’s knowledge, Morgan’s knowledge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Lady Malleson’s knowledge,—that was the
worst,—and lastly Hambley’s knowledge, but his
contempt for Hambley was so great that he could
disregard everything from that quarter. But he
could not pretend to himself to disregard the knowledge
of those other three; it infuriated and mortified
him. Lady Malleson knew him for what he
was; knew him for worse than he was, despised
him more than he deserved. He had to bear this,
added to his loss of her; and he found it hard.
Once his angry pain drove him to write to her, as
lackadaisical a letter as he could compose, flicking
at her the phrases that he had been slightly drunk
on the occasion of his last interview with her; that
he apologised for presenting himself to her in that
condition, also for whatever wild statement he might
have uttered; he sent the letter; in his mind he followed
its journey; he wept bitter and angry tears
on the morning when it must be received.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>IV</h3>

<p class='c010'>Warily, above all, must he tickle Gregory’s suspicions.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one knew of the system that grew up then in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>that house. The house was secret enough at any
time; now it contained a secret within its secret.
It contained the pursuit of Gregory by Silas, the
difficult tracking-down, the requisite, progressive
measure of suggestion, the pieces of paper bearing
the poison of a phrase, the impotence of the dumb
man, his efforts to escape from his tormentor, then
his return in his cravings for a greater certainty.
Silas was intent upon his own skill; a touch here, a
touch there; he placed them with a sharp and delicate
artistry. His only fear now was that Gregory might
refuse to go with Calthorpe, and to forestall that
danger he got hold of the overseer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope, Mr. Calthorpe, you’ll keep Gregory to
this job. You know he’s diffident,—to look at the
way he sticks to those vats, he who’s fit to manage
the engine room!—and now he’s saying that you’re
wanting him to go out of charity, like, and if he
thinks that, he won’t be beholden to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll go in to him now, and fix it up once for all.
There’s no charity about the matter; I don’t want
Gregory to <i>talk</i> to the plants, I want him to <i>look</i> at
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I knew I only had to mention it to you,” said
Silas demurely.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>
  <div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>V</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Gregory was torn. He was bitterly unwilling to
forego the chance offered to his solitary ambition.
He was forty-five, and he had given the whole of his
youth to the patient, meticulous study of machinery;
could he decline the chance, on the strength of a few
words from Silas,—roguish, busy old Silas! always
meddling at something, never letting well alone—a
few words that perhaps were rooted in nothing but
Silas’s imagination? No, he couldn’t decline it!
But what if Silas were right? Nan was young,
Morgan was young, he constantly saw them talking
together, talking when Nan should have been working
and when Morgan, more naturally, might have
been kicking a ball with other young men on the
green. Here he became full of gloom. Should he
charge Nan with it? no, women were too artful; he
would learn nothing through charging Nan. Better
to trust Silas, then by the time he came back from
Birmingham Silas could tell him as a sure fact
whether or no.... For the first time he began to
think of the consequences, of the obligation that
might be laid upon him.... Perfectly honest, he
envisaged facts unflinchingly, in the sole light under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>which they offered themselves to him. He was not
a man to admit alternatives.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had only one slight hesitation: was it fair to
lay a trap for Nan? But he discarded the doubt.
If she were innocent no trap could catch her; if she
were guilty, he had the right to protect his interests
as best he might; he and Silas both had that right.
They were both handicapped; their whole lives were,
in some measure, the lives of animals at bay.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>VI</h3>

<p class='c010'>He spent the interval before his departure in
making observations for himself, prowling round
when he might least be expected, entering his house,
suddenly and noiselessly, or even looking in through
the window,—which, being tall, he could do with
ease,—and sometimes on these occasions he saw
Nan and Morgan together, talking, in the midst of
their occupations, but he never saw more than that.
To see them talking was, however, a source of exasperation
to him; he fancied that the most tender
words were passing between them under his very
eyes, an affront, an outrage, that drove him to gnaw
his finger-tips in the same way that Silas did, and to
fly the house lest his black looks should arouse their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>vigilance. His behaviour became wild and unaccountable.
When he was alone with Nan, he turned
roughly demonstrative, while behind his caresses
lay the intention of finding out whether she would
wince. It was all too clear to him that she did wince.
More than once he was upon the point of questioning
her, and again upon the point of refusing to
leave with Calthorpe, but he crushed these impulses.
If he remained, he might never know, so wily and
circumspect would they be; if he went, they would
throw off much of their caution before blind Silas.
Silas was a good watch-dog, who in ten days would
nose out certainty. To the suspense of those ten
days Gregory would expose himself; a martyrdom
which he undertook in the bleak spirit of a martyr,
grimly, without heroics, in the stern desire to win
truth at the cost of pain.</p>

<p class='c008'>She winced—oh yes! she winced. She turned
away from him, said he bothered her, kept herself
unnecessarily busy. The more she evaded him, the
less willing was he to leave her alone; he followed
her when she fled into the scullery, and with a gasp
she became aware of his silent presence as his hands
were laid from behind upon her shoulders. This
was a persecution worse than the verbal persecution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>she had endured from Silas! She prayed ardently
and with terror for the day when he should go. The
ten days’ reprieve stretched luminous as a lifetime—but
even then there would be Silas, Silas honeyed
again, when, all her wits cried to her, he was fifty
times more dangerous. She thought that without
Linnet she would have become truly distracted; yet
even to Linnet, at home, she dared not speak overmuch.
She could have kissed the forewoman of
her department who again sent her to his room with
a message.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>VII</h3>

<p class='c010'>She knocked at his door with no less timidity
than she had done the first time, her hand clasping
her beating heart. His voice called “Come in!”;
she slipped in; his dim room and the shining alembics
were lovely and mysterious, like a fairy-story,
after the chill of the bare linoleum-lined passage
she had just followed. In a moment they were
close to one another, their fingers wove together
without knowing how it had so come about; the
fact of being unexpectedly alone came like a draught
of water to the thirsty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hate that passage leading to your room—it’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>like a prison,” she murmured, raising her hand to
his bright hair; “it so cool and dim in here; I wish,
oh, how I wish I could work in here helping you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It might be arranged ...” he began enviously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh no,” she said, shaking her head, “we mustn’t
think of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re never really alone,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They looked at each other gravely and pitifully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It does seem so hard,” her small voice took up
again, “that you and I, who have never done any
harm, should be spied on and hunted, because that’s
what I feel: hunted. We haven’t done any harm,
have we? only in our thoughts, that is,” she amended,
scrupulous, “and even then I don’t think it’s terrible
harm to wish we might sometimes be alone. I try
not to wish for more than that, Linnet; I do indeed.
You mustn’t come so close to me, please,” and she
put out her hand to push him away a little.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why mustn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know quite well: I can’t bear your nearness.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nan, you are the most provoking mixture of
frankness and prudery....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t mean to be. I came straight to you when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>I got into the room, because I was happy and forgetful,
but I am sorry; that wasn’t encouraging
you to behave as I want you to behave. You know
what I tell you: we can <i>talk</i>, no more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But talk can lay up trouble too, you know,
Nan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her face took on a startled look, as a dismayed
child’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What! do you mean we ought to give that up
too? Oh, no, Linnet, I couldn’t bear that, indeed I
couldn’t; you mustn’t suggest it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I don’t suggest it; is it likely? Only I
think you trick yourself into believing what you
want to believe, and if your conscience does prick
you, you try to salve it—and I dare say succeed—by
imposing some quite hypocritical limitation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you laughing at me or not? Or are you
serious? do you mean that I ought not to see you
at all or talk to you? perhaps you are right....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nan, you are too perverse! I only mean that
if you allow yourself to talk to me, and allow me to
talk to you, and to make love to you, you might
consistently allow me to go further, to take your
hand, for instance, without pushing me away when
I stand quite respectfully beside you.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“I see what you mean; I can’t argue, but I think,
please, I would rather go on in the same way as
before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well,” he said ruefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And why do you say ‘make love’?” she harked
back after a little. “As though it were just a way
of spending the time? Anyway, I think I would
rather you did not; we can talk quite well without
that, and then you need not think I am hypocritical.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You do keep me in order, Nan, don’t you?” he
said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I am often very weak and cowardly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are only cowardly when you won’t face
what is to become of us,” he replied, with more
seriousness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again she looked startled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, please, Linnet, I don’t like talking about
that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, but, my dear,” he said, “you know quite
well that we cannot go on indefinitely as we are at
present; you ought to be the first to realise it, with
your scrupulous mind always splitting hairs and
dwelling on niceties. If it were light come, light go,
between us—there a kiss and here an arm round you—it
would be different. But you know it is not like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>that. It is perhaps your very prudery that puts the
whole thing on a different footing. Anyway you
know that it is a matter of all our lives....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, it is, isn’t it?” she said, with a contented
sigh, and leaning up against him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nan, you distract me!” he exclaimed, “I say
that it is for all our lives, and you murmur with
pleasure, as though the whole thing were thereby
settled. In the meantime I am neither one thing
nor the other; I am neither your friend, nor your
husband, nor your lover.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but you are surely....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what am I? I wish I knew!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My lover,” she said in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nan, don’t hang your head so; for pity’s sake
don’t; you are too charming when you do it. No, I
am not your lover ... worse luck....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you do love me, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good God, do you doubt it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you never say so. You never said it.
Silas had to say it for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I’ve said so since.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh ... <i>since!</i>” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, my darling Nan, a little way back you
forbade me to speak of love to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“Yes, you see,” she said with another sigh, less
contented, this one, “I want to have nothing on my
conscience, nothing, nothing, nothing—except my
thoughts, and I can’t help those.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Won’t you tell them to me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I told them to you, they would be on my conscience,
and that’s where I don’t want them to be.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are deplorably logical, when it is for my
undoing,” he said, sighing in his turn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I had a laden conscience, I should become a
coward. If I became a coward, I should never have
the courage to face Gregory,” she said, checking the
points off on her fingers. “No, stop: I know what
you’re about to say, ‘then you do mean some day to
face Gregory.’ I can’t answer that, and you must
be patient to let these ten days go by; maybe by the
time we’re in the middle of them I will have got
back my wits. I’m too scared now to have any wits
at all. What is going on in our house now? you
know no more than I do, and yet you know just as
I do that there is something strange. It’s something
between Silas and Gregory. Oh, it’s dreadful
to think that there should be something between
them which they are working out for themselves,
with all their difficulties, because they can’t ask <i>our</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>help, either yours or mine. It frightens me so. Oh,
my dear, it’s horrible to be afraid! Linnet, you
must take care of me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t give me much chance....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I know I don’t; I’m bad to you, I know. I
seem to turn this way and that for a way out, and
things press upon me, and then I make you suffer for
it. Put it down that I scarcely know what I’m
doing....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I know you don’t, my pretty, my poor
pretty, only tell me about it, if that’s any help,
and don’t let things get magnified in your mind
bigger than they ought to be; hills look steeper
than they are, you know, before one starts going up
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh,” she said, her eyes brimming, “you’re good
and patient, indeed you are. I hardly understand,
yet, what’s come over us, that sometimes my breath
comes short and I shut my eyes and think I must
faint away with the longing to see you. I wish,
sometimes I wish that something would happen—something
quite outside this life, I mean,—to relieve
us; I don’t know what I mean, rightly. But
it’s the weight ... and the longing ... I can’t
keep still under it, at times; I have to get up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>move about ... the longing ... the burning.”
She put her hand up to her throat as though she were
physically oppressed. “And I put questions to myself—about
you, I mean—and the answers come
springing without my having to think. They leap
out, the answers do. Would I die for you? Oh, so
gladly! would I starve for you? yes, and never a
word to let you know. Would I die if you died?
I’d pine if I lived an hour after you’d gone. Would
I give myself up to you? yes—to beat me if you
chose; I’d shut my eyes and let you.... That’s
love, isn’t it?<a id='t231'></a> It’s like striking a bell; it clangs back
at once. And now—I can’t help saying it—for
ten days there’ll be times when we’re alone, and
I’ll be less starved than I am now; it seems I’ve
just been keeping alive for this, and reach it all
spent and gasping. Oh, nothing, nothing more!
only to talk to you, and look at you; we’re strangers
still. I want to <i>drink</i> being with you. Then I’ll be
able to think, and we’ll sort everything out, and get
it clear. Only now I’m too parched for you, and too
frightened of <i>them</i>. You must decide everything
for me, and tell me what to do, and then take me
away,—oh, take me away!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She clung to him as she besought him, abandoning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>herself like a frightened child, and putting her arms
up round his neck exactly like a child.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My God, I didn’t know you could speak so,
or feel so. <i>I</i> felt so, but I didn’t dare to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t know either ... one doesn’t know....”
She had sunk so unrestrainedly against him, that
but for his support she would have slipped down
without resistance upon the floor. He felt that she
would lie there, like a shot bird, at his feet, making
no effort to rise, and letting her will glide away from
her in a passive extinction of self; it would be for
her the most exquisite, and at the same time the most
spiritually voluptuous experience of her life. As it
was, she had never known anything like the wild,
fainting rapture of this half-surrender. “Linnet,
Linnet,” she said, pushing him away, “where are
we? it won’t do; we’re being swept along; I’m
afraid. Go right over there, to the other side of the
room; no, farther away than that.” She directed
him with an imperious urgent finger. “You mustn’t
come any nearer. Promise. Sit down on that chair.
I’ll stop over here.” She leant her head back against
the wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now we couldn’t well be farther apart,” he said,
having obeyed her. They were both pale as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>looked at one another across the width of the room,
and their breath came and went quickly between
their parted lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s to be like this the whole time that Gregory
is away. Then when he comes back I can tell him
everything. If we had been different, I should tell
him less easily.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Morgan was just able to follow the ethics of this
argument.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now I’m going away,” she continued; “you
mustn’t move. If you moved, I should run to
you....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Nan!” he said, stretching out his hands to
her across the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no, no,” she cried, vigorously shaking her
head from side to side, the shake becoming more
vigorous as her need for determination increased.
“Oh, my darling heart,” she cried, “I want so to
come to you,” and she fled from the room, leaving
him unbalanced and perplexed, and in half a dozen
minds as to whether he ought to submit as he did to
her directions, or to take the law away from her by
adopting a bolder course.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>She lay still asleep in her bed while Gregory prepared
himself for his journey. He trod in stockinged
feet upon the boards of the bedroom, throwing
articles of clothing into a carpet bag, and stopping
to glance at his wife who, with her hair loose on the
pillow around her small face, looked like some fragile
child, and like a child’s too was the shape of her
limbs beneath the thin covering of blanket. She lay
sleeping; her lips parted. Gregory had purposely
not roused her. It was her undoubted business to
go downstairs, light the fire, and get him some breakfast,
but he would forego the meal sooner than watch
her moving about the house he was that day abandoning.
He did not wish to carry away the picture
of her at her familiar tasks, in which, he imagined,
she would so soon be watched by another. In his
fancy he pictured Morgan entering the house as
soon as he, Gregory, had safely left it. Would they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>breakfast delightedly together? or would the fear
of Silas counsel prudence? Again, as many times
before, he was upon the point of renouncing his
journey. He looked at Nan with his fists clinched,
a storm of hatred and possession tearing him. His
placid inward life, running as smoothly as the machines
with which it was always occupied, had been
disturbed lately, disturbed with a violence he would
not have suspected; he was troubled and resentful,
directing his resentment particularly against Nan
who had brought this disturbance upon him. He
glared at her as she lay asleep. He thought angrily
that he should be allowed to live as a privileged
designer of engines, not drawn into the fury of
domestic calamity. His nature, once roused, held
elements so harsh and intolerant, he knew, that it
fitted him all too well for a part in such a calamity.
Had he been aloof, indifferent ... ah! how he
coveted that gift of indifference. He had it not;
he was too much of a Dene. So he dressed himself,
packed his bag, and brooded resentment over Nan.
She slept on; breathing softly; unconscious.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was ready, but for his coat. He stood in his
shirt sleeves looking at Nan and wondering whether
he should wake her or slip away to the station with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>no farewell. Then he bent down and slid his arm
beneath the pillow, lifting her bodily towards him.
She woke with a cry, to find Gregory’s face near
hers as he knelt on the floor. It was very fortunate
that he could not hear the cry, which, at first merely
startled, changed to horror as she recognised him.
His sardonic smile and her widened eyes were terribly
close; their two faces, by reason of their nearness,
seemed large to one another. She pushed with
both hands against his chest, struggling silently;
only half awake, she had not the wisdom not to
struggle; now, she knew only his distastefulness.
He held her, hardened to a cold fury by her resistance.
He could see all her muscles exerted in the
effort to get rid of him; even the corners of her
mouth were drawn tight, and her eyes were fixed
on him in concentration. She could not plead with
him, as she could have with another man; their strife
must be soundless; she pushed, and twisted herself
within his grasp, both quite in vain, then, relaxing,
she lay quiet, with his arm still beneath her. She
stared up at him. She knew, and was terrified by,
the expression in his eyes. He drew his hand from
beneath her and sketched a rapid phrase on his fingers,
at the same time moving towards her. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>answered vehemently in the same manner, her arms
pitifully slight and delicate as the loose nightgown
fell back from them, and the fingers racing in gesticulation.
His whole face darkened as he read;
she saw that an angry obstinacy was taking possession
of him. She tried to escape from the opposite
side of her bed, but he seized her again, holding her
down, determined, revengeful, and unshaken by
pity. She sought wildly in her mind for some means
of release, finding none, when she heard Calthorpe’s
voice calling for Gregory beneath the window.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>II</h3>

<p class='c010'>She was saved, he had gone, flinging on his coat
and snatching his carpet-bag, but for long she remained
trembling and fearing his return. She shuddered
at intervals as she remembered their struggle,
conducted in that horrible silence; their antagonism
had been so condensed; none of it could slip away in
words. She could still feel where his fingers had
gripped into her flesh. If Calthorpe had not come!
Now, now, they were on the road to Spalding; she
was alone in the house, she was to breakfast with
Silas and Linnet. Her shudders of horror gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>place to the sweet shivering she knew when she
thought of Linnet, an etherealised desire, a trembling
of her spirit more than of her body, a going out
towards a young and fit companion, who by a refinement
of perfection was also a lover. Gradually
she ceased to think of Gregory, and lost herself in
the other thought, lying propped up on her pillow
with an unconscious smile of heavenly happiness in
her eyes and upon her lips. She rose presently,
and in the same dream started to dress, delighting
in the touch of the cold water she splashed over her
throat and arms. The puritanical neatness of each
garment, and the fibre of her laundered linen, likewise
satisfied her as she became clothed. She had
noticed how, without any exaggeration of fancy,
small physical experiences were intensified of late,—colours
were brighter, the song of birds more ringing,
her flesh more sensitive to the touch, and in looking
at people she had observed how the pores of
their skin were distinct, or the firm planting of eyelashes,
and sweep of eyebrow,—all these things, that
were foolishly unimportant, but that added a vividness
to daily life. She was in every detail more
keenly alive; her nostrils dilated to smell the air, and
she touched the sill of the window, where the wood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>was faintly warm under the sun, with a sense of
comradeship. She moved, too, with a difference; her
tread became resilient; her foot was springy as it
poised upon the ground. Her small head carried itself
with a light elasticity in the air, and she was actually
conscious of the soft mass of her hair that caressed
the nape of her neck as she turned her head. She
had a wish for woods and cornlands; to sit in the
roots of a tree beside a brook, allowing the water to
eddy between her staying fingers; to bathe her body
in a lake or in the surf of the sea. So, in loving one
man, one loved the whole company of earth? Love
was illimitable indeed, if it conferred that privilege,
a wider thing than mere absorption in a fellow-being
that was a creature, after all, of limitations as narrow
as any other.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>III</h3>

<p class='c010'>They were alone, the three of them, the absence
of Gregory so startlingly unprecedented that despite
Silas’s presence she obtained a foretaste of complete
and sudden solitude with Linnet. She was admitted,
she, the starved, to a feast of dominion. She found
herself translated into a world where she, most marvellously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>was the object of reverence and solicitude,
and under this warmth of spoiling her natural grace
expanded even beyond the anticipation of his delight.
Aware that those ten days were but a reprieve, she
gave herself up to making the most of them,—in so
far as was consistent with the narrow rulings of her
conscience. Linnet, exasperated at times, but ruefully
submissive always, acknowledged and obeyed
her imperious orders. She was very happy in her
control of him; all the happier, perhaps in the knowledge
that she owed it solely to the consent of his
chivalry, without which (O exquisite danger!) her
security would, like glass, be shivered.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was, unforgettably, Silas. Silas proclaiming
himself a friend, but, nevertheless, remaining a
spy, a jailer. Silas who seemed to come upon them
with a queer noiselessness; who cried, “Well?” over
their shoulders, and who then, suddenly swooping
down upon them, swept with his hands to learn
whether they were sitting close together, or apart.
They were always apart. Angered, he would say,
“Well?” again, this time with a forced benevolence
in his voice; and sometimes he would amuse himself
by walking along between them, hilarious, taking an
arm of each. This method of surprising them, this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>sham benevolence, this reasonless hilarity, struck
cold terror into Nan as something indefinably sinister.
Once, too, when she met Silas tapping his way
over the cobbles towards the letter-box, on the envelope
which he carried in his hand she read the
name and address of Gregory. (Silas had adapted
with delight this method of communication. He
rubbed his hands together when he thought of
Gregory, in Birmingham, tearing the flap open and
scanning the lines of those able, indefinite letters.)
But at other times she was puzzled by the hungry
interest with which he questioned her, and in which
her ear did not detect the usual unalloyed malignity,
but rather a wistfulness, a desire to be admitted to
a lovely secret, a genuine craving for participation,
however humble, however incomplete, and beggarly
upon the fringe of riches. At such times an eagerness
crept into his face, as he bent forward to question
her, his hands hanging loosely interlaced between
his knees, the strong cords of his throat
standing out in sculptural masses of light and
shadow; words came from him almost timidly, as
though he feared to presume or to give offence, but
must nevertheless urge his examination, irresistibly
tempted and allured. Nan, who sat sewing, looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>into his face with wonderment. Experience taught
her mistrust, but instinct taught her a heart-searching
pity. There was always that same feeling which
she had for Silas, which she could not explain, and
which nothing,—no dread, no premonition, no
knowledge,—could permanently destroy. It reawakened
always at the sound of his yearning voice.
Once it led her to put her fingers on his forehead,
“How much you’ve missed!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He sprang away, detected at the very moment
when forgetful absorption had suspended his defiance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve had all I wanted. Make no mistake. You’re
wasting your sloppy pity....”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>IV</h3>

<p class='c010'>Gregory had been so suddenly and so completely
withdrawn! She adapted herself without bewilderment
to the new order. She became as a girl, betrothed
to Linnet. Their relationship had all the
innocence of a betrothal. Her past life might have
been blotted out, the future so far distant (down a
vista of ten days!) as to be, for all practical purposes,
negligible. She could have drawn from this
a proof that the violence of the years lived between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Gregory and Silas had made upon her being only
a mark such as might be soon effaced. She, the
true Nan, had slipped away from violence, because
violence was so unalterably alien to her. The lesson
of violence was a lesson she might provisionally
learn, but would never long remember. She went
out now to meet the condition she had always
wanted: the secure tenderness, the settlement, once
and for all, in her choice; she was not one who would
demand variety upon the face of existence. Variety!
she had had it; excitement, uncertainty, passion, and
the weight of failure all around her, reckless because
resigned; she had had all that, compressed within
the limits of an iron circle; those were not the things
she wanted. The things she wanted were the things
that Linnet could give her.</p>

<p class='c008'>The subtle sarcasms of Silas were incapable of
troubling her quiet discernment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>XIV</h2>
</div>
<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>Their last afternoon, a Saturday. They believed
that Gregory was to return at seven; only Silas knew
that he was to return at five. With the hoarding
instinct that this knowledge might be useful to him,
he kept it a secret. They were very silent, and remained
close to one another, holding hands. How
grave they were! They were very self-contained,
husbanding all their strength. He knew that they
meant to beard Gregory that evening, but he, Silas,
equally, meant to outwit them, and he thought with
satisfaction that his cunning was greater than theirs.
He considered their silence with an irony more
tragic than any of them knew. The pain that their
company had cost him during the last ten days; the
pain, too, which his own desire for their happiness
had cost him; his angry, resentful love for them
both; the strain of remaining true to his principles,
and his vindictiveness (Christine! Christine! always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Christine, recurrent, gnawing,) all this mingled in
his mind to a state of folly with which he was almost
unable prudently to deal. He acknowledged that
he had been partly to blame. He had drawn out
Nan’s confidences. But his temperament inclined
him harshly towards self-flagellation....</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only a little time now, Nan, before he’s here,”
he said. “You’ll have much to tell him, much that’ll
interest him. Remember, if you want any help, I’m
here: Silas is here. Him being my brother, we
understand one another, like you and Linnet understand
one another. Blood brothers is close like
lovers. Close as lovers.—But what call have I to
talk of love, seeing I never knew it, nor wanted it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He went outside and sat on the doorstep, leaning
his back against the closed door. The village street
was deserted, distant voices sounded from the green;
in the faint warmth of the April sun the paint of
the door smelt hot, and flies buzzed stickily in the
corners of the woodwork. Silas sat there clasping
his knees, and swaying slightly to the ironical rhythm
of his own thoughts. He felt like a jailer, keeping
those two imprisoned inside; they were happy, in
spite of the imminent crisis; merely and childishly
happy because they were together,—that sufficed;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>he had learnt during those ten days the perfection
of their happiness. Nan had betrayed, under his
questionings, more than she had probably intended
to betray, and under the pain of defrauded envy
he had accumulated a store of knowledge. They
seemed to <i>be</i> one another; it was not so much sympathy
that they enjoyed, as identity. Silas swayed
himself slowly backwards and forwards; he put the
tip of his tongue between his teeth and held it there;
he tapped his boots softly together because of
his enjoyment. They were inside, talking; Gregory
would be home soon. It tickled Silas’s fancy
to think he had a surprise up his sleeve in store
for them; he, the unwanted third! he, the ostracised
of the village! they would soon learn,
all of them, that he still had fangs. He strained his
ears to catch the first sound of the train, which,
after stopping at Spalding, crossed the fenny country
at some little distance. He wished for the dulled
rumble indicative that the train was upon its journey
and therefore that Gregory and Calthorpe were
upon their way to Abbot’s Etchery along the dyke,
but at the same time he wished this hour prolonged,
an hour so entirely after his own heart. He had
so many revenges to take, so many old debts to wipe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>off, that no luxury of procrastination could be too
great. Provided only, indeed, that the completion
was sufficient, and sufficiently inevitable; and as to
this he had no misgivings.</p>

<p class='c008'>He never heard the train. He continued to hear
only the distant shouts from the green, the small
noises of insects, and the murmur within the room—not
a continued murmur, only an intermittent one—and
the first sound that drew him from his torpor
of satisfaction was that of footsteps on the cobbles
and Calthorpe’s voice, in its somewhat irritatingly
cheery tones, “Friend Silas! well, I’ve brought back
Gregory safe and sound, and how are you all at
home?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gregory stood planted in the middle of the street
watching his brother’s face for his greeting of Calthorpe.
His throat heaved, and his suppressed violence,
which was entirely apparent, made his stiff
black travelling suit and bowler hat seem puerile
and ridiculous. He was in one of those primitive
moods when civilised trappings become laughable:
an angry man in a bowler hat.... Not only angry,
but convulsed with anxiety, and with a rage that
prayed only to be released. Yes, even though that
rage must destroy his soul, it craved for an outlet.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>A man so minded would not have thanked the reassuring
speech that drove back the straining rage as
unwarrantable. The bag he carried was as paper in
his hand. His limbs seemed to burst out of his
clothes; strong muscle impatient for nakedness. His
throat reared itself out of his collar. His hands
protruded starkly from his cuffs. Civilisation upon
him was as preposterous as the naked man wrestling
beneath was superb. He stood with his feet planted
wide apart, in the attitude of one who awaits and
encourages an attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas was petulant at being taken by surprise;
“I didn’t expect you,” he said, as though he had been
cheated of his due. “Well, now that we’re here, let
us come in,” said Calthorpe, still good-humoured,
but slightly uneasy; he would have liked the numbers
increased, not fancying the part of sole interpreter
between the brothers; was he to act as light to the
one, and as sound to the other? The constant companionship
of Gregory, and, above all, the railway
journey that day, and the walk along the dyke, had
convinced him that all was very far from well
amongst the Denes. “No,” said Silas, standing up
and stretching his arms crucifix-wise across the door,
“you can’t go in there.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Gregory saw the gesture, which was intelligible
enough, although he did not hear the words. A perverse
relief swept over him, at having his worst
dread confirmed. A horrible inarticulate noise broke
from him, which made Calthorpe swing round in
his direction. “Good God,” said Calthorpe appalled,
“it’s like a baboon,” and he continued to stare,
expecting the noise to be repeated. Silas, too, had
heard; “Yes—like a brute,” he said, becoming transfigured
with delight as he saw the certainty of
manœuvring that brute with the cunning of his own
intellect. Gregory never uttered a sound unless he
was extraordinarily moved. “Tell him, Mr. Calthorpe,”
said Silas, “that he can’t go into my cottage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He wants to know why,” said Calthorpe, having
delivered this message and received the answer from
Gregory’s quivering fingers. “He looks as though
he might spring upon you at any moment, Silas.”
He watched, anxiously, first one and then the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gathering himself together, is he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes—he doesn’t look as though he’d hold himself
in much longer. Oh, you wouldn’t chuckle if
you could see him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell him to trust me and not to be a fool.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>“He says, was it true?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell him first, that he must let me manage
things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t like the look of this, Silas; I’m all in the
dark.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never mind, sir; you just tell him to trust
me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll be at your throat if I don’t,” and the communication
passed silently from Calthorpe to Gregory.
“He says he will trust you a bit longer, but
he wants to see things for himself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas appeared to be perplexed by his brother’s
impatience, and by the danger of Calthorpe putting
two and two together.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ask him if he will wait till to-morrow,” he said,
at length.</p>

<p class='c008'>This suggestion so enraged Gregory that he leapt
at his brother and was only warded off by Calthorpe’s
appeasing gesture. He fell back a pace, and
framed a message with shaking hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He says,” said Calthorpe, “that he will be
damned if he waits another five minutes. And I am
damned myself, Silas,” added the honest instrument,
“if I understand a word of this, or if I will go on
letting you make a cat’s-paw of me for your black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>tricks. Call Mrs. Dene, who perhaps knows what
you are up to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas was outwardly calm, but alert. He must
lose no time in breaking up the trio.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall explain everything to you, Mr. Calthorpe,”
he said earnestly, still standing with his
arms flung wide across the door, “but he’s a dangerous
man, my brother. He’s in a dangerous temper.
To tell you the truth, Mr. Calthorpe,” he ran on
with extreme glibness, “he suspects some one of tampering
with his designs—but keep that for yourself.
I’ve got the proofs inside my cottage, only I didn’t
expect you so early. We must get him away. Tell
him to go into his own place and change his clothes,
and I’ll send his wife to him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, there seems to be no harm in that,” said
Calthorpe dubiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Believe me, sir, I’m acting for the best.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“H’m—you seem mighty eager to get your
brother out of the way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Surely you only have to look at him, Mr. Calthorpe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Calthorpe looked, and, having done so, he asked
Gregory to go. “But I am damned if I understand,”
he said again, taking off his hat and scratching his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>head. “You Denes are hard fellows to make out,”
he added in an access of irritation, seeing the expression
on Silas’s face, and indeed he felt that his
irritation was only small and petulant beside the
anger of Gregory and the sardonic malevolence of
Silas. If it were not for Nan, he would wash his
hands of the whole lot of them. His easy-going
philosophy of life was too greatly disturbed by the
stress and inexplicable ferment of the Denes. He
saw Gregory scowling in his indecision, than a message
came from the able fingers, which he passed
on to Silas. “He says he will wait for his wife in his
own cottage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell him she shall join him there,” said Silas
grimly.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>II</h3>

<p class='c010'>Devastation met Nan’s eyes when she hurried
into her cottage. The white lace curtains were torn
from the windows and the pictures lay scattered
about the floor. Any ornament or attempt at decoration
had been snatched from its place and flung
across the room. In the midst of this wreckage
stood Gregory, in his shirt sleeves, his chest heaving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>and his bronze forehead shining with sweat. He
held out to Nan a paper upon which he had written,
“<i>Plain deel tables and chairs is good enough for us,
without fal-lals.</i>” She read it, and with tears running
over her cheeks knelt down to gather up her
broken china, collecting the pieces tenderly into
the shreds of the curtains. Gregory came towards
her and kicked the things away from her hand. She
knelt upon the floor, gazing up at him without protest
but with inexpressible sorrow. Every time she
renewed her gesture of gathering up the shares, he
scattered them again by a kick, until in discouragement
she desisted, waiting for his next manifestation.
She dared not get up while he stood over her
in his threatening attitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas came in; Nan found herself turning to him
as towards a friend. Here, at least, was one who
had some influence over Gregory! She felt herself
the alien before the brothers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas was sympathetic. Silas commiserated. Let
her go away for a little, and he would soothe Gregory.
Gregory had behaved like a peevish child. He,
Silas, would remonstrate. He even patted Nan’s
shoulder kindly as she passed him, drying her eyes,
to leave the brothers together as she was bid.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>It was not long before she returned, and saw Silas
alone, with the wreckage created by Gregory’s rage
still around him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silas!” she exclaimed, going up to him, “where’s
Gregory?—where’s Linnet?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You ask for them in the same breath?” he replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I must know!” she said, catching hold of
his arm and peering urgently into his face. “Silas,
what dreadful excitement is making you so quiet, so
strung-up like? Don’t think that I can’t see it.
You’re gathered all into yourself, like as though you
were waiting, and your face looks so strange. Silas!
you are in a trance? For pity’s sake, speak to me.
If you won’t speak, I must go. I can’t stop here.
I’m going out—to look for them both. Only, if you
can tell me aught, won’t you do so, Silas? you could
if you would, I’m sure, and I’m so broken by terror,
Silas, if you can help me now you’ll surely not refuse?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>“The sinner must expect to pay,” he said
slowly, his eyes wide open and glazed into
impassivity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I haven’t sinned, God be my judge!” she
cried, wringing her hands together. “Silas, I do
conjure you, as you hope for mercy yourself, let
your lips speak; tell me—for you know—where
they’ve gone, and why? Tell me where I can find
them. Oh, if I were there, I could come between
them, and if Gregory must injure me, why, then, he
must, but I should <i>know</i>, I should know; it’s this
doubt, this knowing that they’re together, this not
knowing what they may be saying! it kills me, Silas.
Silas, see here, listen to me, Silas: I’ve not been bad
to you, have I, Silas? We’ve not been bad to you,
Linnet and I? Well, have a little mercy on us now:
we’ve loved, yes, but we’ve done no more wrong
than that. I wouldn’t, with Gregory away. We
were to tell Gregory everything, so soon as he came
back. You know that, Silas.—Oh, you’ll not help
me: I see it by your face. What are you thinking
of? I never saw you look so terrible. But I haven’t
time to beseech you more; I must go, and take my
chance of finding them, and may your wicked heart
be afraid for whatever goes amiss.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>“You’ll not go,” he said suddenly, holding her
down.</p>

<p class='c008'>She struggled against him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silas, you hurt my wrist; let go, I say. Oh, I see
it: you’re in with Gregory, you’ve tricked us; my
God, what can Linnet and I do against you and
Gregory?—You laugh at that, you fiend,” she said,
quietening into despair; “you laugh,” she said, rocking
her head piteously from side to side, “you laugh,
you laugh!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gregory’s honest,” he pronounced; “I’ve got
three of you, not two, in the net. Gregory’s my dupe
too; he’s an honest man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, then, why? in God’s name, <i>why</i>? what is
it, Silas? are you mad or sane? Are we to be your
toys? What have we done to you? What had
Hannah done?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hannah?...”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You killed Hannah.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He still held her down on a chair, and by the high
standard of their present stress the retrospective
admission that he had killed Hannah seemed to them
both subordinate. He was breathing heavily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hannah laughed at me and fooled me; she was
rough with me, and sweet-tongued enough with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>other men. I wasn’t going to be fooled by Hannah.
She’d thrown in her lot with mine, and if I suffered
she should suffer too. That’s why I killed Hannah.
The world’s been made black for me; I’ll make it
black for others.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s awful, your revengefulness.... But I tried
to make it <i>less</i> black, Silas, so did Linnet; look,
I don’t ask you now to help me, or to tell me anything,
but only to let me go,—won’t you, Silas?
It’s so easy for you to keep me here; I can’t escape
from your strength if you’re determined to hold me.
But I beg you; I beseech you. Often you tried me
high, and if I failed you I ask your forgiveness.
Only let me go now. Don’t <i>help</i> me; I don’t ask
that; only give me the chance of helping myself.
I ask with all the patience and humbleness in me;
I’m in bitter anguish, Silas. Gregory’s hard enough,
Heaven knows, but he’s got the heart of a woman
next to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gregory’s less bereft than I; I only have my own
mind to feed upon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Surely that’s true of us all, blind or not blind?”
she said, in a weak attempt at argument.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I was born with a darkened mind, not only
with darkened eyes,” he exclaimed violently, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>with renewed determination. “I’m cursed with the
one as much as with the other, and though God
knows no justice I’ll throw in my quota to balance
the scales: I never deserved the curse I got, but,
since I got it, I’ll deserve it; and I’ll see to it that
others get something they don’t deserve, as I did
myself. Did you ever consider what blindness
meant? To be dependent on others’ charity, to be
a burden, a maimed thing? above all to have to submit
to pity, when you were born with a spirit that
wanted the <i>envy</i> of other men?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silas, Silas, all that’s just words, and meantime
you’re draining the life out of me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re not Nan,” he said, “not Nancy Dene;
you’re just the victim of <i>my</i> curse. What does it
matter that you never knew Lady Malleson? Blind,
you call me? why, I think we’re all blind—blind
instruments, not more blind one than the other.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gregory only breaks my things,” she cried out,
kicking with her toe at a fragment of china, “but
you’re putting all my happiness in pieces.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Silas, “I told you he was an honest
man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s why we would have put everything to
him honestly,” she began with extreme earnestness;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>“we would have told him we hadn’t sought one another
out, but that something led us.... We
had talked it all over, what we would say. Silas, will
nothing soften you? You talk about courage: we
meant to be brave, not deceitful; you even urged
us, once, after the fire, to hold to one another if
we loved truly. You said we were the builders;
you talked beautiful. I never knew a man talk like
you talk, sometimes, Silas. You seem all lifted-up....
Maybe you wouldn’t see so bright if you
didn’t see so black. I had a feeling for you; oh yes,
I had! Though all the while I knew about Hannah,
and after Hannah, Martin. But I didn’t know then
that after Hannah and Martin it would be me and
Linnet—and Linnet! You seemed kindly to us, of
late. Was it <i>all</i> a trap? did you never <i>feel</i> kindly
while you spoke us fair? Oh, Silas, everything’s
going from me. It’ll go badly between Linnet and
Gregory. If I was there, I’d manage; you fight
things as they come along; and Linnet, he needs
me to look after him. He’ll be stiff and buttoned-up
with Gregory, but that’s not the worst: it’s Gregory
I’m afraid of. Not speaking, he puts everything
into his fists; you know what he’s like, Silas. And
Linnet’s my life,—my life. I’m telling you more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>than I ever told him, save once. Won’t you let me
go?” She moved her wrist tentatively within the
clench of his fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I waste, I fail,” said Silas, holding her wrist
more closely than before; “the day you came from
Sussex to Abbot’s Etchery you were meant to fall in
with me. I told you already, you’re not Nan Dene;
you’re a thing. You’re part of my design. You,
and your little loves, and dreams and what-not—I’ll
<i>grind</i> you. When I was a boy, I set out to give
people as bad a time as I had myself. My mother
hated my father and was afraid of him; he used to
jeer at her when he saw how much she hated Gregory
and me. Because we were deformed, you understand.
Once I was given a rabbit for a pet; well, I
put out its eyes with a needle. That makes you
shiver: I hold that it was only just. Now I’ve got
you; you’ll be better game than Hannah, because that
was over too quickly; but you, once Linnet is taken
away from you, and you’re brought back where you
belong, to my brother, to be my brother’s wife, his
faithful, broken, submissive wife—I’ll know that
every day your prettiness will wither, you’ll never
sing, you’ll never put out china for Gregory to
break, you’ll shun young men because you’ll have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>known the pain of love, you’ll bury your heart below
a mound, and your hopes beside your heart, and so
you’ll grow old between Gregory and me, and we’ll
speak less and less, until you and I sit as silent as
Gregory himself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He paused, but she gave only a small moan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You were right,” he went on, “Linnet is with
Gregory now. I sent Linnet off, and now I’ve sent
Gregory to join him. You won’t see him again,—not
if I know Gregory. Gregory won’t tell us what
took place between them,—not he! He’ll come home
presently, and you’ll get our supper, and have yours
between us, and after supper Gregory’ll get out his
drawings. And every evening afterwards will be
the same,—exactly the same. Maybe you’ll have
children and watch them growing like me; you don’t
know, yet, what seeds might be lying in your children’s
minds. I’d watch over them, never fear;
I’ll not have my nephews grow into milksops, into
sentimental dabs....”</p>

<p class='c008'>He spoke with such virulence that Nan cried out,
unbearably slashed. That seemed to gratify him,
for he settled down into an intermittent growl:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your children.—Your sons.—But Denes, all the
same.—Who stands alone?” he muttered, taken up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>on that revived train of thought, “Who stands single?
no one, it seems; your sons wouldn’t be solely
yours. Where’s independence? not in this world.
O folly! to let it slide, even in part, into another’s
keeping. Where would be your trouble now, if
Linnet hadn’t your heart? Freedom goes when the
heart goes.—Not strong enough.—Loneliness and
labour,—yes, surely.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Tisn’t all that, ’tis happiness you grudge,” said
Nan, suddenly bitter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s your little view: there spoke Nan Dene!—And
if you thought that, anyway why did you
flaunt your happiness in my face? Eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Silas, you kept asking me....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And if I did! Was it part of your kindness that
you boast of, to give me the glimpse of a feast I
couldn’t share? Was it meant as a treat? You’d be
willing to give me kindness; I couldn’t expect more,—a
blind man like me. Very lucky to get as much.”
He roared suddenly with laughter. “That’s a pallid
sort of thing to offer,—I won’t give you thanks for
that,” he cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nan thought that he was really going mad; madness
and disaster had broken crashing over her
world. The forces loosed were too great and too bewildering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>for her to strive against; the sanity of
Linnet, the sanity of their joy, was lost for ever, lost,
foundered in the madness of the hurricane brought
about by Silas and Gregory. For Gregory there
might be some excuse; Silas appeared to be possessed
by a senseless, impersonal fury of destruction. She
thought she might as well argue with the unleashed
elements as with Silas in his bitterness and diabolical
delight. Yet life still moved, still endeavoured;
and, pricked by its promptings, she struggled,—</p>

<p class='c008'>“You hurt me and Linnet because we are safe to
hurt; we can’t hurt you back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s not true!” he yelled.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was utterly astonished at the effect she had
produced.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Silas,” she said, inspired, “we all know you
for a coward. We all know your talk for bluster.
Did you think we didn’t know that, by now?”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>II</h3>

<p class='c010'>She had not at first spoken tauntingly. She
thought she had meant only to pronounce the truth.
Then she perceived that the truth had cut deeper
than any taunt. She was as a naked, unarmed person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>driven up against a wall, that finds suddenly a
blade put into their hands. She held it, but was
perplexed how best to use it. She made a thrust,—</p>

<p class='c008'>“All your talk is talk. It costs you nothing to
ruin Linnet and me. It cost you nothing to throw
out Martin.—And Hannah,” she whispered, “and
Hannah!—What have you ever done that hurt yourself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>From the tremor of the hand still clutching her
wrist she discovered that he was shuddering.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You dare speak to me so?” he threatened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hit me,—I can’t hit back,” she replied, upheld.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he made no movement to injure her. His
defeat was as complete as it was sudden. Against
his determination, which no appeal could have
moved, no bribe impressed, she had turned the sole
effective weapon, his own intrinsic weakness. There
was no repair possible to a breach that had started
from the inside. She had struck down upon the rot
within him and the inner walls of his defences
crumbled.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>III</h3>

<p class='c010'>Failing to understand what she had brought about,
she sat watching him, alarmed, perplexed, but,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>through her confusion, something stirred, which
might perhaps not be called hope, but which was at
least removed from the despondency of death that
had lately descended upon her. He maintained upon
her wrist a grasp that had now become automatic;
he sat bent, covering his eyes with his free hand.
She recognised only that he must work his way
towards his decision without interference on her
part; he was beyond such interference, and although
the stealing away of time roused her anxiety to the
pitch of physical pain, she constrained herself to
wait, tense, in the knowledge that Silas passed
through a crisis no less momentous than her own.
He moved his body uneasily about, and unintelligible
mumblings like groans escaped him. He
fought; he wrestled. He fixed that sightless gaze
upon Nan, saying in tones of reluctant abnegation,
“And am I to end so?” He cried out once, startling
her by the anguish that tore his voice, “Failure!
failure! beaten by a jeer! weakness beats me; poor
blind Silas, poor weak Silas, couldn’t stick to his
purpose even when his end was in sight!” One thing
was clear, that he suffered intensely; but the complexity
of his sufferings was hopelessly beyond her
comprehension. She could only wait, and, trembling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>watch. She no longer tried to free her wrist,
fearing by that mere flutter of self-assertion to recall
his former mood. She tried to pray, and her
mind produced a prayer like a child’s, “Please, God....”
His ravings had ceased, and nothing now
came from him but the small phrases that jerked
themselves to the surface, after which the riot and
despair of his thoughts were again submerged.
“Flotsam and jetsam,” he muttered. Striking his
chest, he said, “Here stands Silas Dene, who helped
two children to happiness,—let that be my epitaph!”
“Where’s truth? do I know my own mind, or don’t
I?” After these disjointed remarks, that emerged at
intervals, like milestones marking off the painful
road he was travelling, he released her and stood up.
“I’ll save you yet,” he pronounced. “Stay you there
and let me manage things my own way. You’ve
nothing to fear now,—once there was something to
fear in me, perhaps, but that’s a thing of the past.
That’s finished. You stay where you are, and I’ll
bring Linnet to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You may be too late,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not too late,” he replied, with such certainty
that she was misled into thinking he had some inner
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>He put her quite gently away from him as she
tried to detain him, pleading to be allowed to help.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>IV</h3>

<p class='c010'>He passed out of the house, guiding himself by
his finger-tips that brushed lightly against the doorpost.
Not daring to disobey by following him, Nan
saw him thus lower himself to the doorstep, whence
he set out down the street in the direction of the
factory, slipping his fingers along the walls of the
houses. She wondered whether she might venture to
follow at a distance. Inactivity seemed, in that pregnant
hour, intolerable.—Slowly she put her shawl
over her head and stood in the doorway holding the
edges of the shawl close under her chin, and exerting
her eyes to keep pace with Silas. He strode on
as though confident in perfect vision; only that outstretched
hand slipping rapidly from house to house
set any peculiar mark upon his progress. But Nan,
with a solicitude whose almost maternal quality she
recognised with a shock of dismay, thought, “He’s
going much too fast,” for she made no allowance for
the quickening of all his instincts under the exalted
condition of his mind. She had now no enmity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>towards him. She was too well-used to his violence
to bear him any grudge for that, and moreover, in
her eyes, if he intervened on her behalf and Linnet’s,
he was redeemed. She recognised obscurely that he
had considered himself shamed,—shamed to the extent
of catastrophe—but this problem she banished
as beyond the scope of her understanding. If he
would but come to her aid and Linnet’s she would
accept,—oh, with what thankfulness!—the benefit
at his hands without perplexity or investigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had turned the corner, and, keeping her distance,
she began to follow.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>V</h3>

<p class='c010'>When the factory came in sight she realised from
the absence of movement about the buildings, that
six o’clock had long since struck and that the work-people,
in consequence, had left their employment
for the day. The evening shift, reduced to a minimum,
would be occupied in one or two specialised
portions only,—in the boiler-rooms, for example, or
amongst the engines. For all practical purposes the
Denes had the place to themselves. A terrible doubt
overcame her: might Silas, still, be playing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>double game? She pressed onward, dwarfed by the
immense sheds and chimneys that bulked around her.
She could see Silas as he crossed the tessellated
square. He advanced with scarce more caution, although
he had now no wall to guide him, and, having
no stick, held his hand at arm’s length before him
until some contact should bring him up short. She
had the dread that, did he but turn round, he would
perceive her. She walked on tiptoe, skirting the
sheds under cover of the great water-butts. Sick
terror possessed her, and the imminence of disaster
weighed her down.</p>

<p class='c008'>She saw Silas reach the foot of the long, outside,
ladder-like stairs that led to the upper gallery of
the main building, and, setting his feet confidently
upon the iron steps, begin to climb.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>VI</h3>

<p class='c010'>He climbed without pause, dwindling to a small
figure aloft, to Nan so far below. She leant in collapse
against a huge tarred water-butt, pitiably undecided
whether by ascending after him she would
do more harm or good. The question was of such
importance to her, but its resolution depended upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>her poor unguided wisdom, and she shrank from the
responsibility. Still Silas climbed, and stood at last
upon the topmost landing, and disappeared from her
view.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he disappeared she hesitated no longer, but
ran from her shelter of concealment, and started
pulling herself up on the ascent. She went up the
steep stairs, pulling hand over hand on the iron rail
that served on one side as banister. She thought
that she would soon be on a level with the black
smoke floating from the chimneys. Through the
perforations of the iron steps she could see the
ground below, and when she turned her head she
found that the roofs of the village had become apparent.
She had never been up this way before, but
always by the inner staircase. But Silas, of course,
had chosen the more gaunt, the more perilous
method of approach.</p>

<p class='c008'>Landings on the way up admitted to two other
storeys; these she passed, having a glimpse of machinery
within. The top windows, square and
bleak, were those of the gallery,—Gregory’s gallery.
She was upon the landing, and slipped in through the
door which had been left ajar. Everything moved
quickly now, too quickly to admit of any interference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>or direction, and what would be done now
would never have the chance of being undone, nor
would there be time for any reckoning or dexterity,
in the vehemence of colliding passions that listened
to no argument and were endowed with a strength
beyond the reasoned energy of will.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inside the five-hundred foot length of gallery the
vats stretched away in low regular ranks, under the
even light of the flat windows, pale-brown with dirt.
The soap in the vats shifted and breathed; spat and
slithered as it boiled. Linnet lay unconscious on
the ground, as though he had been dropped there by
a man surprised at his work; cast down with no
more care than a toy by some formidable strength;
and forgetful of prudence, Nan was instantly on her
knees beside him. The other two were at a little
distance, obvious of all save their last terrible combat.
Speech and sight respectively denied them, a
finer understanding taught them mutual penetration.
They might have been ringed about by flames. They
were alert only for one another. Kneeling on the
ground at Linnet’s side, Nan kept her gaze fastened
upon them: it was to her very strange that Gregory
should appear so fully aware of his brother’s change
of front. That he was aware of it, there could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>no doubt; he had set himself ready in the attitude of
a wrestler awaiting an onslaught. And Silas,—had
heaven miraculously restored sight to Silas, that he
advanced with such slow certainty towards his
brother? He crouched, stalking him. He never
once blundered against a vat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gregory leapt suddenly upon him, and in an instant
their limbs were locked.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>VII</h3>

<p class='c010'>Thus grappled, they seemed to sway as a double
monster heroically proportioned, a Herculean group
against the flat light of the pale-brown windows.
So superbly matched were they in physique that
they remained almost motionless, swaying very
slightly and with difficulty under the strain of their
utmost effort. That stillness and that silence accompanying
so supreme a struggle, were startling, portentous,
and unnaturally impressive, as though the
contained violence within were too mighty, too self-sufficient,
to seek the relief of any visible outlet
whether of noise or movement. Their meeting was
a muffled encounter of force with force; it had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>the crash of a collision. So they remained, arrested,
stirred only by that almost imperceptible rocking,
until doubt might have arisen whether they so held
one another grasped with deadly intent, or, as the
likeness between them more palpably emerged, in a
brotherly welding against some danger imminent
and extraneous. Their feet yielded not at all from
their original planting upon the boards, their arms
flung around one another had neither relaxed nor
shifted, the slight angle at which their bodies were
bent remained the same. The group they formed
was of bronze beneath the spanning iron girders.
But indeed the question became one of endurance,
while the body’s tension, flung on the hollowed hips,
the quivering thighs, the knotted calves, and lean
ankles, strained and cracked under the sustained
tautening of human sinew. The one who was first
to yield, by so much as the stagger of a foot, would
find the advantage narrowly pursued, his opponent
weighing down upon him, pressing him hard across
their meagre margin.—Yet, were they meeting in
alliance or hostility, the two brothers, so alike in
their carved features, in the duplication of torso and
huge opposing members?</p>

<p class='c008'>Very slowly they bent together, straining; very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>slowly straightened themselves again to their formation
of deadlock. All this strife took place without
a sound, and seemed to occupy a long period of
time, as though that group were permanent in the
gallery, taking on the dingy monochrome and adapting
itself to the proportions of the gallery’s
enormous setting. Nan, the impotent onlooker,
could foresee no ending, no outcome. She saw that
Gregory stared into his brother’s face with a concentration
of hatred. There was very little to indicate
the intense pressure of strength that each was putting
forth. But a difference was creeping in,—certainly
a difference was creeping in. Gregory’s
determination was becoming the determination of
misgiving, Silas’s that of ultimate mastery. He did
not appear triumphant, but quietly sure. Throughout,
he had been guided by that security of vouchsafed
insight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nan dared not stir. She continued to kneel beside
Linnet, who still lay with his eyes closed, and the
mark of a bruise blackening rapidly on his temple.
She was deeply thankful for his unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other two held her eyes. Gregory shifted a
foot backwards to steady his balance; it was their
first definite movement. Their faces were close;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>not angry, but concentrated, and Silas’s was like a
cast mask of unflinching patience. It frightened
Nan to look at Silas’s face, he was so immeasurably
beyond both the greatness and the smallness of
things human. He was like an incarnation of purpose,
summoned for one set, finite task. His pressure
was beginning to tell upon Gregory, who sought
to improve his grip, but lost ground in so doing, and,
staggering backwards, was driven to prop himself
against the side of a vat. Here their grapple became
more desperate, more final, in the same unbroken
silence. Nan’s imagination could not extend
to reasons or to outcome; it did not extend beyond
the struggle of the moment. She was numbed;
all energy was absorbed by that group of wrestling
Titans.</p>

<p class='c008'>She bent down to Linnet, whose eyes had opened
dazedly upon her. When she looked up again she
saw a change. Silas had stooped until his arms
clasped his brother below the waist. For one terrible
moment she saw Gregory lifted off his feet, his arms
flung impotently up, his body bent back in its supreme
effort, his throat extended, to give vent to the
most hideous sound she had ever heard uttered. Silas
bore him up for a moment in that gesture of appalling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>ravishment, rearing like a centaur in the full
magnificence of his strength; and with one mighty
heave cast the burden from him into the boiling
yellow slime of the vat.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>XVI</h2>
</div>
<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>I</h3>

<p class='c010'>Nan rose upright, crying aloud; the wind of terror
had blown violently in upon the stillness of the
gallery. Silas towered amongst the vats; he wore
an air of unearthly triumph and exaltation. “Nan!
Nan!” he said, stretching up both arms with the
gesture of the fanatic over the blood-offering.
“What have you done? what have you done?” she
cried. “Saved you,—bought you free,” he answered
loudly, still lit up by his triumph, but she hid her
face in her hands, and moaned, shuddering.</p>

<p class='c008'>Morgan stirred, and lay gazing without comprehension.
He whispered Nan’s name; she started,
and turned to him, but seeing his eyes opened she
wildly laid her hand across them. “You mustn’t
look,—you mustn’t look,” she said, distraught, in
the effort to preserve him although she understood
nothing herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>In that absence of understanding she saw only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Silas erect there with his arms still stretched out,
as a sinner might stare into heaven, or a martyr into
hell, accepting either, because enlightened as to both.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silas!” she called, unbearably alarmed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Builders and destroyers,” he replied from afar,
and in the tone of one giving utterance to a quotation
of secret familiarity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What am I to do?” she cried, in a lost whisper.
She felt immeasurably removed from the succour
of mankind, forced into the kindred of the Denes,
amongst grotesque surroundings, and grotesque and
terrible events, high above the comings and goings
of the temperate world. There was no room in
her mind for the thought that the body of Gregory
was pitched sinking through the morass of that
deadly cauldron. Then the word “Gregory!” came
to her, and, wonderingly, she pronounced it aloud,
“Gregory,” thereby bringing realisation upon herself,
and the first conscious dismay.</p>

<p class='c008'>She went to Silas and seized him by the arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silas, speak to me....”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned his eyes full upon her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“O God, can you <i>see</i> me?” she murmured, shrinking
away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There was nothing else to be done,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“Oh, yes, yes!” she protested, inarticulate in her
extreme distress and bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There was nothing else,” he repeated.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>II</h3>

<p class='c010'>She perceived then that, according to the temper
of his mind, there was indeed nothing else. She
ceased to protest, overtaken by the actual consequence
of his uncompromising creed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have killed Gregory,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>A change came over him; his look of flaming justification
died down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hannah. Martin. Christine. Gregory,” he
said sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nan was crying; she was frightened by the monstrous,
fantastic extravagance of the scene. Silas
must have decoyed her to the heart of some distorted
maze, where death was not solemn, nor grief
venerable; and therein she was lost. Crying, her arm
crooked across her eyes, she made her way over to
Linnet, who had risen to his feet. “It’s soap,—<i>soap</i>,”
she stammered, taking refuge against him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He held her, since no words could help, and she
made herself as small as possible within his arm.
Silas called out to him across the gallery, “I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>thrown Gregory into the vat,” pointing to the wrong
vat, and forcing himself to laugh very loudly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what is to become of <i>you</i>? madman!” Linnet
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was a new idea to Silas.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I must think of getting away, it’s true,” he
replied, suddenly busy; and he moved excitably in
what he thought to be the direction of the door.
But he had lost his bearings, and struck himself
against the corner of a vat. “What’s that?” he
called out. “I’ll have no nonsense,” he added, speaking
in a tone of incipient panic which he tried to
cover up by menace. “There is no time to be lost;
I can’t be kept hanging about here, or I shall be
taken. I must get away, and hide somewhere. I
must hide in a barn. You will have to bring me
food. The first thing to be done is to get away.” All
the while he was speaking he moved about, groping
amongst the vats, trying to find his way out, but
amongst that number, where nothing helped him
to distinguish one from the other, with each step
he became more confusedly lost. “I’m blind!” he
cried, at last standing stock-still, and from the
anguish in his voice it might have been believed that
he had never made the discovery before.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Then he started to stride about, up and down, in
and out of the gangways left between the vats, taking
any opening that offered itself. Linnet tried
to speak to him; he was interrupted, reasonable
words fluttered vainly amongst the vibrant emotions
with which Silas’s soul was strung. Neither Linnet
nor Nan could have any cognisance of such a diapason.
“You shall not come near me,” Silas
shouted; “how am I to know you wouldn’t give me
up? although I killed Gregory for you; and I loved
Gregory.—We’ve destroyed one another. It’s
right,—people like us ought to go. There’s no place
for us. I can’t save myself,” he said, “I’m blind;
every one can take advantage of me. How could
I live hidden for weeks in the country? But I’ll
give them trouble first....”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was full of a crazy, hopeless defiance; he
turned upon them the wild flash of his sightless eyes.
“It <i>must</i> end in defeat,” he said, “what match is a
blind man for clear-seeing men? You had me at a
disadvantage, all my life,—all of you! You were
orderly, while I struggled. Gone under! but not as
tamely as you think.” As he spoke he found the
door that gave access to the outside stairs, and
dragged it open, blundering out into the air on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>iron landing. They saw him there, against the sky,
silhouetted for a moment, before he disappeared on
his reckless descent of the hazardous stair.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>III</h3>

<p class='c010'>Evening was rapidly falling, but the coming of
night would befriend him, since it could not hinder.
As he reached the foot of the stair he stood for a
moment in hesitation. He listened. The tessellated
square was silent, but for a drip of water off a gutter
into one of the great butts; no footsteps rang across
the cobbles; no voice exclaimed “Why, Dene!”; no
call from Nan or Linnet echoed down to him from
above. He felt himself more utterly alone than
ever in his life before, more finally at bay. Never
for an instant did the idea of giving himself up
cross his mind. He was calmer now than he had
been up in the gallery, where he had bruised himself
so cruelly against these serried vats. Here, at least,
he had space around him; and out there, where he
meant to go, would be still wider space, the flat freedom
of the Fens, the sky above his head, and night,
the only ally that could begin to equalise his chances
with other men.</p>

<p class='c008'>But there would be uncertainty. Always the uncertainty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>whether he had or had not been seen. He
might be ringed about by pursuers closing in upon
him, and not know it. He must make up his mind
to that; he must make up his mind to the knowledge
that defeat would overtake him in the end. This
knowledge came to him with a strangely familiar
quietness; it was as though it had been with him all
his life, although he might not have given it a name.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the silence of the evening he passed beyond
the factory and gained the road on the top of the
great dyke stretching across the Fens. Upon its
eminence he paused, forlorn, uncertain, and derelict.
That illumination which had sustained him before,
seemed now to have deserted him; he no longer
trod with the same assurance, but cautiously,
afraid of making a false step and of slipping down
the sides of the dyke, afraid of being seen, upright
upon the skyline, yet not venturing to leave the
road and to make his way across the flooded country.
Yet as he stumbled on, he realised that therein lay
his wisest course: the floods would reveal no footmarks,
and he would be less conspicuous than erect
on the height of the dyke. In so far as his hopelessness
could devise a plan, that was the plan to
follow. He struck across the road, and, crouching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>on his heels, allowed himself to slither down the
escarpment. At the bottom he found the water,
icy about his ankles, and shivered at its sinister
touch. Nevertheless, he plunged forward into it,
his hands outstretched before him, determined to put
all possible distance between himself and Abbot’s
Etchery. Behind him the three chimneys of the
factory vomited their black plumes of noiseless
smoke that trailed across the sky, but of this he did
not reckon; he was aware only of the cry of the
curlew circling above him, and of the marshy
ground that sucked back his steps beneath the water.
He fought his way, each foot held down and his
progress hampered as in a nightmare, and with an
effort he dragged one foot after the other stickily
out, ploughing onwards into the unknown breadth
of the marshes, ignorant of his surroundings, of
whether night had fallen, concealing him, or whether
the last bars of day still made of him a distinguishable
mark. And, for his greater misery and discomfort,
as he advanced across the submerged fields, he
came periodically to the ditches that were their
boundaries, and knew them because his footing
suddenly failed him and threw him forward into the
water, pitching down upon hands and knees, so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>presently he was drenched, and the touch of the
water which at first had been only about his ankles
now conquered his body also, little by little, penetrating
to his skin, glacial as the presaged touch of death.
Still he advanced, striving towards no known prospective
refuge, but merely, irrationally, to increase
the distance, without considering the paltriness of
the help those few poor miles could afford him.</p>

<p class='c008'>By now, although he could not be certain of it,
night had fully come. A huge, low moon stole up
above the horizon, and sailed slowly higher into
the heavens over the flooded country. In its light
the few bare trees stood up like twigs, black and
stark; and still across the now shining expanse of
water the blind man held on his laborious, hindered
way the splash of his steps breaking the placid surface
into a ripple of jet and silver. He had no notion
how far he might have gone; he was uncertain
even whether he had succeeded in keeping straight
in the same direction. Every now and then he came
to a hillock of higher ground, which lifted him for
the moment out of the floods, and every now and
then he stumbled into a ditch, from which he extricated
himself, his teeth chattering; and all the time
he walked with his hands groping before him, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>they could not save him from the ditches that seemed
to lie in wait for him and to take pleasure in trapping
him unawares. He thought that he must have
been walking half the night. Even the curlews had
ceased to cry long since, and no owl hooted across
the waste of waters. His extreme weariness deadened
him; but fever reanimated him; and it was a
conflict as to which would gain the advantage. At
one moment he thought that he must sink down from
exhaustion, even into the floods; the next moment,
a bout of fear and determination spurred him on,
and he splashed forward, behind his groping hands,
while obscure mutterings came in the immense
silence of the night from his moving lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>Morning found him crouching beside some
meagre trees upon one of the hillocks out of reach
of the water. His hair was matted, his eyes bloodshot,
his clothes wet and dankly clinging to his
limbs. He crouched as closely as possible to the
ground, feeling about for the shelter of the trees,
which, leafless as they were, offered no shelter at
all. He crept about amongst them,—they might be
half a dozen in number, a small clump;—he crept
over the twenty square feet or so of the little island
on which he was marooned, and once or twice he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>seemed tempted to renew his passage through the
water, for he cautiously adventured down to its
edge, and stretched out his foot towards it, but,
although he essayed this on different sides of the
mound, he always took his foot back shuddering
as soon as he encountered the water, and withdrew
himself in the same shambling, furtive fashion to
the shelter of the trees.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was here that in the afternoon he was found by
the men who were out for his capture. They came
beating across the flooded fields in extended order,
as men beating for game. When they first descried
him from a little way off, he still was stealing about
his patch of refuge, rambling uneasily and without
purpose, now coming down to the water’s edge,
now out of sight over the curve of the hillock, now
reappearing to slink between the trees. Uncouth,
haggard, his clothes torn and soiled, his hands always
at their unhappy groping, his useless eyes turning
hither and thither, he resembled some half-crazy
castaway that might have subsisted there for days
on berries and foul water, too bemused now for
further endeavour; too broken in spirit for any
frenzy of despair; merely acquiescent in his climax
of the long premonitory years; waiting for the end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>which, after all the riot and the burden, could not
be otherwise than welcome.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>IV</h3>

<p class='c010'>After that day clean April poured sunlight over
the marshes. Flocks of plover settled on the emerging
pasture; and the sea, whose presence was divined
rather than seen over the edge of the fens, ceased
to be a threat, and became a promise, for the
peculiar void of the sky above it, where land stopped
short, grew luminous with the transparency of
shower-washed spaces. The very roads, the very
railway line with its straight, shining metals,
streamed away, avenues of promise and escape.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like a great bowl opened to the gold-moted
emptiness of heaven the country lay, recipient of
the benediction.</p>
